      "content": "Consider how you can represent the processes and their hierarchy. A common approach is to use a dictionary to map each process ID to its children, which can help you traverse the tree structure."

      "content": "Think about how to build this mapping: for each process ID in the `pid` list, check its corresponding parent in the `ppid` list and create a child list for each parent. This will help you visualize the process tree."

      "content": "When you have the mapping, consider how to perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the process that needs to be killed. This will allow you to find all descendant processes."
