  "questionNotes": [
    "Constraints: Ensure you understand the maximum length of the binary string and how many operations can be applied.",
    "Indexing: Remember that binary strings are typically indexed starting from 0.",
    "Uniqueness: Focus on generating distinct strings; duplicates should not be counted.",
    "Tie-breaking: If multiple configurations lead to the same string, they should only be counted once.",
    "Return format: Make sure your final answer is returned as an integer representing the count of distinct strings."
