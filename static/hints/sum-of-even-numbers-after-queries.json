    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that after each query, you need to update `nums` and then calculate the sum of even numbers. Make sure you know how to check if a number is even: a number `x` is even if `x % 2 == 0`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to efficiently calculate the sum of even numbers. Instead of recalculating the sum from scratch after each query, think about maintaining a running total of the sum of even numbers."

    {
      "content": "When applying a query, be careful to update only the specified index in `nums`. Make sure to handle the case where the number changes from even to odd or vice versa, as this will affect your sum."

      "content": "You might want to keep track of the count of even numbers in `nums`. This can help you determine how the sum changes after each query without iterating through the entire array every time."

      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. With `nums` and `queries` potentially being very large (up to 10^4), your solution needs to be efficient. Aim for a time complexity better than O(n * m), where n is the length of `nums` and m is the number of queries."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can optimize your approach by only recalculating the sum of even numbers when necessary. For example, if the updated number at `nums[index]` is even, add it to the sum; if itâ€™s odd, subtract it from the sum if it was previously even."
