    "The grid is represented as a 2D array where each element can be a positive integer, zero, or -1.",
    "The starting point is typically at the top-left corner, and the ending point is at the bottom-right corner of the grid.",
    "You may encounter cells with -1 which are considered obstacles and cannot be traversed.",
    "Ensure to handle edge cases where the start or end cell is blocked.",
    "The output should be the length of the shortest path, or -1 if no path exists."
