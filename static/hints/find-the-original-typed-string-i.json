      "content": "Consider the structure of the string. If a character appears consecutively, it may have been typed once or multiple times. For example, in 'aa', it could represent either one 'a' or two 'a's."

      "content": "Think about how to identify groups of consecutive characters in the string. You can iterate through the string and count how many times each character repeats consecutively."

      "content": "Remember that Alice can only make this mistake once. This means you need to consider each group of consecutive characters separately and decide if you want to count them as they are or reduce them by one."

      "content": "When counting the possibilities, multiply the choices for each group together. For example, if you have two groups with lengths 2 and 3, you would have 2 choices for the first group and 2 choices for the second group, leading to 2 * 2 = 4 possibilities."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep track of the total number of possibilities. You might want to use a variable to accumulate the product of choices for each group."
