      "content": "Next, think about how to calculate the hash value of each character. The hash value is simply the index of the character in the alphabet, where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., and 'z' is 25. You can use `ord(char) - ord('a')` to get this index."

      "content": "For each substring, you will need to compute the sum of the hash values of its characters. Make sure to iterate through each character of the substring and accumulate their hash values."

      "content": "After calculating the sum of hash values for a substring, you need to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 26. This will give you the `hashedChar`, which corresponds to a character in the alphabet."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider using a loop to process all substrings in one go. You can use a range based on `n/k` to iterate through the starting indices of each substring."
