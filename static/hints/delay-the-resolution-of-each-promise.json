      "content": "Consider how you can control the timing of when each promise resolves. You might want to think about how to delay the resolution of promises in a sequential manner."

      "content": "Look into using `Promise.all` to handle multiple promises. This method allows you to run multiple promises concurrently and wait for all of them to resolve or for one to reject."

      "content": "Think about how you can introduce a delay before resolving each promise. You might want to create a function that takes a promise and a delay time as parameters."

      "content": "When delaying resolutions, consider using `setTimeout`. You can wrap the original promise in a new promise that resolves after a specified delay."

      "content": "Make sure to handle both the resolution and rejection of promises. You should ensure that if a promise rejects, the rejection is also delayed appropriately."

      "content": "You will need to keep track of the total time taken for all promises to resolve. Think about how you can accumulate the delays and the time taken for each promise."

    {
      "content": "What happens if one of the promises rejects? You need to decide how to handle this case. Should the total time still include the delays of the other promises?"

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where promises might resolve very quickly or very slowly. How will your solution handle these extremes? Make sure your logic accounts for varying promise durations."
    },
    {
      "content": "To implement the solution, you might create a function that takes an array of promise-generating functions and a total delay time. You will need to iterate over the array and apply the delay logic to each function."
