      "content": "Consider how you can find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has. This will be your benchmark for comparison after distributing the extra candies."

      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the `candies` array. For each kid, you will check if their candies plus the `extraCandies` is greater than or equal to the maximum candies found."

      "content": "Remember that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies. Therefore, your comparison should allow for equality (i.e., `>=` instead of just `>`)."
