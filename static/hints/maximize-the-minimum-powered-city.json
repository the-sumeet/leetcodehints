      "content": "Consider how the range 'r' affects which cities are influenced by a power station. If a power station is in city i, it affects cities from max(0, i-r) to min(n-1, i+r). This will help you visualize the power distribution."

      "content": "Before adding new power stations, calculate the initial power for each city. You can create a new array to store these values. This will give you a baseline to work from when you start adding the new stations."

      "content": "When adding new power stations, think about how to distribute them optimally. If you place multiple stations in one city, how does that impact the power of nearby cities? Consider the cumulative effect."

      "content": "A binary search approach could be useful here. You might want to define a function that checks if it's possible to achieve a certain minimum power level across all cities after adding the k stations."

      "content": "When implementing the binary search, define your search space. The minimum possible power is the current minimum of the cities, and the maximum could be the maximum power achievable if all k stations were placed optimally."

      "content": "In your helper function for checking feasibility, keep track of how many additional stations are needed to reach the desired minimum power level for each city. This will help you determine if k stations are sufficient."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when r is 0. In this case, each power station only affects its own city, and the solution will be straightforward."
