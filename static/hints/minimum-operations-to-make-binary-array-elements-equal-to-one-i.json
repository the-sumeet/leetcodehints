      "content": "Start by counting the number of '0's in the array. If the total number of '0's is not divisible by 3, it might be impossible to turn all elements into '1's. Why do you think that is?"

      "content": "As you traverse the array, focus on the leftmost '0' you encounter. Flipping three elements starting from this position can help you move towards your goal. What happens to the elements after you perform this operation?"

      "content": "When you flip three consecutive elements, you are not just affecting the '0' you want to change, but also the two neighboring elements. Keep track of how many flips you perform and how the array changes after each operation."

      "content": "Think about using a greedy approach: always flip at the first '0' you see. This might help minimize the number of operations. However, consider how this might affect future '0's in the array."

      "content": "Be cautious of the boundaries of the array. If you reach the end of the array and still have '0's left, think about how the length of the array and the flipping operation interact. Can you still make all elements '1'?"
