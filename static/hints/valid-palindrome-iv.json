      "content": "Consider how you can check if a string is a palindrome. You might want to compare characters from the start and end of the string, moving towards the center. Think about how you would implement this check."

      "content": "Since the problem allows for some modifications to make the string a palindrome, think about what types of modifications are permitted. Are you allowed to change just one character, or can you change multiple characters?"

      "content": "Identify how you would handle cases where the string is already a palindrome. If the string is a palindrome, you can immediately return true without any modifications."
