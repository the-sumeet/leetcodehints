      "content": "To start, understand the definition of 'wiggle sort'. The array should be rearranged such that nums[0] < nums[1] > nums[2] < nums[3] and so on. This means that for every odd index, the element should be greater than its neighbors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. You may need to handle cases where the array has fewer than 2 elements. What should the output be in such cases?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can compare elements in pairs. For example, if you are at index `i`, you should check if `i` is even or odd to determine the required relationship with its neighbors."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to iterate through the array using a single loop. As you loop through the array, adjust the elements based on their index (even or odd) to maintain the wiggle property."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you encounter an element that does not satisfy the wiggle condition, you will need to swap it with the appropriate neighbor. Be careful with your swap logic to ensure you don't disrupt the already established wiggle pattern."

    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of sorting the array first. If you sort the array, how can you then rearrange it to achieve the wiggle sort? Think about how the sorted array can help you place elements in the correct positions."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle duplicates in the array. If you have multiple occurrences of the same number, how will that affect the wiggle sort? Ensure that your solution does not inadvertently create equal adjacent pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to use a two-pointer technique or a similar strategy to help you place elements correctly without needing to sort the array explicitly. This could help maintain O(n) time complexity."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep testing it against various edge cases, such as arrays with all identical elements, arrays with only two elements, and arrays that are already in wiggle order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the modified array. Make sure your function signature matches the requirements, and remember that the output should be the same array modified in place."
