      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the data provided in the sample test case. There are three tables: Users, Orders, and Items. Each table has specific columns that you will need to work with."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the relationships between the tables. For example, the Orders table contains references to both the Users and Items tables through buyer_id and item_id. This will be crucial for joining the tables."

      "content": "Think about how you can use SQL-like joins to combine the data from these tables. You will likely need to perform at least two joins to get the information you need."

    {
      "content": "Consider what information you want to extract from the combined data. Are you looking for total sales per brand, or perhaps the number of users who bought items from each brand?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When joining the tables, remember to use the correct keys. For example, to join Users and Orders, you would use buyer_id from Orders and user_id from Users."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the join types you are using. An inner join will only return records that have matching entries in both tables, while a left join will return all records from one table and matched records from another."

    {
      "content": "Once you have joined the tables, you will need to group the results to aggregate data, such as counting the number of orders per brand or summing the total sales."
