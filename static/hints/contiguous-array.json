      "content": "Remember that the goal is to find a subarray with an equal number of 0s and 1s. Think about how you might represent the counts of 0s and 1s. What if you converted all 0s to -1s? This could help in balancing the counts."

      "content": "As you iterate through the array, store the first occurrence of each prefix sum in a hash map. If you encounter the same prefix sum again, it indicates that the subarray between these two occurrences has an equal number of 0s and 1s."
