      "content": "Remember that the most significant digit (the first digit) will have a positive sign. Each subsequent digit will alternate in sign. Think about how you can keep track of this alternation as you process each digit."

      "content": "As you iterate through the digits, you can determine the sign based on the index. If the index is even, the sign is positive; if odd, the sign is negative. This can be done using a simple conditional check."
