      "content": "Identify the board's dimensions and how the pieces are arranged. Are there any constraints on the number of pieces or their positions? Think about how the layout might affect movement."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might represent the board in code. A 2D array is a good choice, where each element indicates the presence of a piece. For example, `board[i][j]` could be `1` if there's a piece at that position and `0` otherwise."

    {
      "content": "Think about the possible moves for each piece. Can a piece move to any empty space, or are there restrictions based on the board's layout? This will help you define valid moves."

    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a function to check if a move results in a peaceful board. This function should verify that no two pieces can attack each other after a move."

      "content": "Consider using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to explore all possible configurations of the board. This can help you find the minimum moves required to achieve a peaceful setup."

      "content": "When implementing your search, keep track of the number of moves taken to reach each configuration. You may want to use a queue or stack to manage the states you explore."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to return your result. You need to return the minimum number of moves required to achieve a peaceful board. Consider what your function should return if itâ€™s impossible to achieve this."
