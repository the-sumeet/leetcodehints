    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the graph in code. An adjacency list or a dictionary of lists might be useful for storing the edges and their weights. For example: `graph[u] = [(v, w)]`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to traverse the graph to find the shortest path from the starting node 'k' to all other nodes. Dijkstra's algorithm is a good choice for this type of problem since it efficiently finds the shortest paths in a weighted graph."

      "content": "Remember that Dijkstra's algorithm uses a priority queue to explore the node with the smallest known distance first. You can use a min-heap to implement this efficiently."

      "content": "As you implement Dijkstra's algorithm, keep track of the distances from the starting node 'k' to each node. Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and all others as infinity."

      "content": "After running Dijkstra's algorithm, check if all nodes have been reached. If any node still has a distance of infinity, it means that node is unreachable from 'k'."
