    {
      "content": "Consider how you would handle the repetition of the tape when you encounter a digit. For example, if you have `s = 'a2'`, you would need to create a tape that looks like `aa`."

      "content": "As you process the string, maintain a variable that tracks the total length of the decoded tape. When you encounter a digit, multiply the current length by that digit."

      "content": "Remember that `k` is 1-indexed. This means that when you are looking for the k-th character, you need to adjust your checks accordingly since most programming languages use 0-indexing."

      "content": "When you reach a digit, you should check if the k-th character falls within the range of the current tape length multiplied by the digit. If it does, you need to determine which part of the tape corresponds to k."

      "content": "If `k` is less than or equal to the current tape length, you can directly find the character in the current tape. If not, adjust `k` by subtracting the current tape length multiplied by the digit."

      "content": "Utilize a stack or a similar approach to keep track of the characters and their corresponding lengths as you decode the string. This will help you backtrack to find the k-th character efficiently."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the digits are very large and how that affects the tape length. Ensure that your approach can handle such cases without overflowing or running out of memory."

      "content": "To get closer to the solution, you can implement a loop that processes each character in `s`, updating the total length and checking against `k` to determine if you can directly return a character or need to continue processing."
