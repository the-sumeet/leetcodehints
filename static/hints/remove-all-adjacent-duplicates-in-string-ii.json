      "content": "Consider using a stack to help manage the characters in the string. You can push characters onto the stack and keep track of how many times each character appears consecutively."

      "content": "As you iterate through the string, if the current character is the same as the one on top of the stack, increment a count. If it differs, reset the count and push the new character onto the stack."
