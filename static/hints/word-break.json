      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to determine if the string `s` can be split into one or more words from the `wordDict`. Consider how you might approach this with a brute-force method first."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can utilize a recursive approach to solve this problem. You could check if the string starts with any of the words in the dictionary and then recursively check the remaining substring."

      "content": "Consider using memoization to optimize your recursive solution. By storing results of already computed substrings, you can avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you are using recursion, remember to check for base cases. For instance, if the string `s` is empty, you should return true, as an empty string can be segmented trivially."

      "content": "You might want to convert the `wordDict` into a set for faster lookup times. This will allow you to quickly check if a substring exists in the dictionary."

      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the string `s` to check every possible prefix against the dictionary. For each prefix that matches, you can then check the remaining substring."

      "content": "Consider using a dynamic programming approach. You can create a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary."

    {
      "content": "When using dynamic programming, initialize `dp[0]` to true since an empty string can be segmented. Then, for each index `i`, check all possible previous indices `j` to see if the substring `s[j:i]` is in the dictionary and if `dp[j]` is true."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when `s` is very short or when `wordDict` contains very short or very long words. Ensure your solution handles all constraints effectively."
    },

      "content": "Finally, make sure to return the value of `dp[s.length()]` to determine if the entire string can be segmented. This will give you the answer to the problem."
