  "questionNotes": [
    "The range is inclusive, meaning both low and high are part of the range to check.",
    "The counts of even and odd digits must be equal for a number to be considered beautiful.",
    "The number must be divisible by k to meet the second condition of being beautiful.",
    "Constraints indicate that low and high can be as large as 10^9, so efficiency is key.",
    "k can be between 1 and 20, which is a small range, making it easier to check divisibility."
