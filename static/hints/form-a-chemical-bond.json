    {
      "content": "Consider the number of electrons each element has. This is crucial because elements tend to bond in ways that allow them to achieve a full outer shell of electrons."

      "content": "Remember that metals typically lose electrons, while nonmetals gain electrons. Think about how these behaviors affect the formation of chemical bonds."

      "content": "Look into the concept of ionic and covalent bonds. Metals and nonmetals often form ionic bonds, while nonmetals can bond with each other through covalent bonds."

    {
      "content": "When forming bonds, keep in mind that noble gases do not typically bond with other elements due to their complete electron shells. This can affect your choices."

      "content": "Try to create a function that takes the list of elements and their properties as input. This function should identify potential pairs of elements that can bond based on their electron configurations."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as what happens if there are no suitable pairs of elements to bond. Your function should handle this gracefully."

      "content": "Think about how to represent the bonds formed. You might want to return a list of pairs or a more complex structure that indicates the type of bond formed."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to check for unique pairs only. For example, if 'Na' can bond with 'Cl', ensure that 'Cl' does not bond with 'Na' again in the output."

      "content": "Finally, outline the logic to determine the bond type based on the elements' properties. For instance, if a metal and a nonmetal are paired, it should indicate an ionic bond."
