      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to split the message into parts, each having a suffix that indicates its order and total count. The length of each part, including the suffix, must not exceed the given limit."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the suffix format `<a/b>` affects the available length for the message content. The suffix length increases with the number of parts, so you'll need to account for that when determining how much of the message can fit into each part."
    },
    {
      "content": "Calculate the maximum number of parts possible based on the limit. The suffix length changes with the number of parts, so you may want to express the total length of each part as `limit - length_of_suffix`."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the last part can be shorter than the limit. This means you can adjust the lengths of the earlier parts to ensure that the total message is preserved."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the message while keeping track of the current index and the number of parts created. You might want to use a loop that continues until you've processed the entire message."

    {
      "content": "As you create each part, ensure that you are correctly calculating the suffix length based on the current part index and total parts. For example, if you have 14 parts, the suffix for the first part will be `<1/14>`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the message is shorter than the limit. In such cases, you can simply return the message with the appropriate suffix."

      "content": "If you find that the message cannot be split into the required number of parts without exceeding the limit, you should return an empty array. This is an important condition to check before finalizing your result."
