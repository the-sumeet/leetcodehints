      "content": "Think about the return value of the `find` method. It should return a boolean indicating whether such a pair exists. Ensure your logic correctly reflects this."

  "questionNotes": [
    "You need to support two operations: `add` and `find`.",
    "The `add` operation should keep track of the frequency of each number.",
    "The `find` operation should return true if any two numbers (not necessarily distinct) add up to the target.",
    "Handle cases where the same number can be used twice if it has been added more than once.",
    "Ensure your solution is efficient in terms of time complexity for both operations."
