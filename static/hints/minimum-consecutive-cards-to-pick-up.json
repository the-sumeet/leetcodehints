      "content": "Consider using a hash map (or dictionary) to store the last seen index of each card value. This way, when you encounter a card value that you've seen before, you can easily calculate the distance between the current index and the last seen index."

      "content": "As you iterate through the `cards` array, update your hash map with the current index of each card. If you find a card that already exists in the map, calculate the length of the segment from the last index to the current index."

      "content": "Keep track of the minimum length of these segments as you go. You can initialize a variable to hold the minimum length, and update it whenever you find a matching card."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, be careful with the indexing. Remember that the indices in your hash map should correspond to the positions of the cards in the original array."
