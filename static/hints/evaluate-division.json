      "content": "Consider how you can represent the entire set of equations as a graph. You will need to create an adjacency list where each variable points to its neighbors along with the corresponding division value."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the queries. For each query `C / D`, you need to determine if there is a path from `C` to `D` in your graph. If such a path exists, you can compute the result by multiplying the weights along the path."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the path from `C` to `D`, a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) could be useful. Remember to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and infinite loops."

      "content": "When you find a path from `C` to `D`, calculate the product of the weights along that path. For example, if you traverse from `C` to `D` through `A` and `B`, you would compute `C/A * A/B * B/D`."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where `C` and `D` are the same variable. In this case, the answer should always be `1.0` since any variable divided by itself equals one."
