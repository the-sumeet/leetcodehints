      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to search for a number (original) in an array (nums) and modify it based on whether it's found. What happens when you find it?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will check if the original number is present in the nums array. What method can you use to search for a value in an array?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that if you find the original number, you need to multiply it by 2. Think about how you can update the value of original after each successful search."

    {
      "content": "You will need a loop to continue searching for the updated original value. What kind of loop would work best for this scenario? Consider a while loop."

      "content": "As you loop, make sure to check if the new value of original is still in the nums array. What condition will allow you to keep looping?"

      "content": "Think about how to handle the case when the original number is not found in the array. What should your function return in that situation?"

      "content": "Take note of the constraints provided in the problem. For example, the length of nums is between 1 and 1000. How does this affect your choice of algorithm?"

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the original number is already at its maximum value or when nums contains only one element. How would your solution handle these cases?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to utilize a set for nums to improve the search time complexity. How does using a set compare to using a list for lookups?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, put together your logic: start with the original value, check if it's in nums, multiply if found, and repeat. Ensure you return the final value of original after the loop ends."
