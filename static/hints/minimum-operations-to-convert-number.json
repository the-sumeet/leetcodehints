      "content": "Consider the range of `x`. The operations are valid as long as `0 <= x <= 1000`. However, once `x` goes outside this range, you cannot perform any more operations. Think about how this affects your strategy."

      "content": "Since the goal can be outside the range of `0` to `1000`, you might need to plan a route that intentionally takes `x` out of bounds. Make sure to explore how you can reach the goal even if it means exceeding `1000`."

      "content": "Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore the possible values of `x`. This way, you can systematically explore all possible operations and keep track of the number of operations taken to reach each value."
