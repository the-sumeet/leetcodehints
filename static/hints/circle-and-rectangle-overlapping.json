      "content": "To find the closest point on the rectangle, you need to clamp the circle's center coordinates (xCenter, yCenter) to the rectangle's bounds. This means restricting xCenter between x1 and x2, and yCenter between y1 and y2."

      "content": "You can use the following logic to clamp the coordinates: \n- For x: closestX = max(x1, min(xCenter, x2)) \n- For y: closestY = max(y1, min(yCenter, y2))"
