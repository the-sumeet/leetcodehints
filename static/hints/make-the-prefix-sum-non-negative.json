      "content": "Start by understanding the concept of prefix sums. The prefix sum at index `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to index `i`. For example, for the array `[2, 3, -5, 4]`, the prefix sums would be `[2, 5, 0, 4]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the problem: you need to ensure that all prefix sums are non-negative. This means that at no point should the sum of the elements from the start of the array to any index `i` be negative."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how negative values in the array affect the prefix sums. For instance, in the array `[2, 3, -5, 4]`, the prefix sum becomes zero after the third element, which is problematic. Think about how you might adjust the array to prevent this."
    },
    {
      "content": "One approach could involve adding a constant value to the entire array. This constant should be large enough to keep all prefix sums non-negative. What would this constant need to be based on the minimum prefix sum?"
    },
    {
      "content": "As you compute the prefix sums, keep track of the minimum prefix sum encountered. This will help you determine the smallest value you need to add to the entire array to ensure all prefix sums are non-negative."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when the array is empty or when all elements are already non-negative. How would your approach change in these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your solution. You will want to compute the prefix sums in a single pass through the array. Consider how you can maintain the minimum prefix sum while calculating the prefix sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the minimum prefix sum, the adjustment you need to make to the entire array is the absolute value of this minimum, if it is negative. This will ensure that all prefix sums are non-negative."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to return the modified array after applying the necessary adjustment. How will you structure your return statement to reflect this?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution is robust. Test it with various edge cases, such as arrays with all positive numbers, all negative numbers, and mixed values. What outputs do you expect in these cases?"
