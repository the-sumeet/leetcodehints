    {
      "content": "Consider how the operation affects the types of chocolates. When you perform the operation, every chocolate type shifts to the next index, wrapping around to the beginning of the array. Think about how many operations you might need to perform to collect all types."

      "content": "Think about the costs involved. For each chocolate type, you can either collect it directly or perform operations to collect it later. Calculate the total cost for both strategies and compare them."

    {
      "content": "Notice that the cost of performing operations is constant (x) regardless of how many chocolates you have collected. This means you need to balance the cost of operations with the cost of collecting chocolates."

      "content": "You can simulate the process of collecting chocolates and performing operations. Start by collecting each chocolate type at its cost, then try performing operations and see how it affects your total cost. Keep track of the minimum cost encountered."

      "content": "Think about using a dynamic programming approach or a greedy strategy to minimize the total cost. You might want to keep track of the cumulative cost as you decide whether to perform operations or collect chocolates."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you calculate the total cost, remember to include the cost of operations each time you decide to shift the chocolate types. This will help you determine whether it's worth it to perform an operation or just collect the chocolate directly."

    {
      "content": "Finally, consider how to structure your solution. You might want to create a function that calculates the minimum cost based on the current state of chocolate types and the costs involved. Make sure to test your solution with edge cases."
