      "content": "First, clarify what the problem is asking for. You need to find the largest subarray of a given length `k` from the input array. Make sure you understand the difference between a subarray and a subsequence."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will define a subarray. A subarray is a contiguous segment of the array. For example, in the array `[1, 4, 5, 2, 3]`, the subarrays of length 3 include `[1, 4, 5]`, `[4, 5, 2]`, and `[5, 2, 3]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to extract subarrays of length `k`. You might want to use a loop that runs from the start of the array up to the index where a subarray of length `k` can still be formed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases. What happens if the array is shorter than `k`? Make sure to handle this scenario appropriately, perhaps by returning an empty result or a specific value."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you extract each subarray of length `k`, consider how you will determine the 'largest' subarray. Are you comparing the sum of the elements, the maximum element, or something else? Clarify this aspect."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to keep track of the maximum value found in the subarrays you are examining. This could be done by initializing a variable to store the maximum and updating it as you find larger subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you find a subarray of length `k`, think about how you will compare it to the current largest. If you are comparing sums, ensure you have a method to calculate the sum efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a sliding window approach. This technique allows you to maintain a running sum of the current subarray, updating it as you move the window across the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases like an empty array, an array with one element, and cases where `k` is equal to the length of the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement your logic to return the largest subarray of length `k`. Remember to consider how you want to represent this subarray in your return statement, whether as an array or just its sum."
    }

  "questionNotes": [
    "The input array can contain duplicate values.",
    "The value of `k` should be a positive integer.",
    "If the array length is less than `k`, handle it gracefully.",
    "Return format should be specified (e.g., return the subarray or its sum)."
