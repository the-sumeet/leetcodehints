      "content": "Consider how you will find the smallest and largest elements in the array. A common approach is to sort the array first, but think about whether there are more efficient ways to do this given the constraints."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you will be performing this operation n / 2 times, where n is the length of the input array. This means you will end up with n / 2 averages to work with."

      "content": "As you calculate the averages, ensure that you are correctly adding the average of the smallest and largest elements to a new list. The formula is (minElement + maxElement) / 2."

      "content": "You can use a data structure like a min-heap and max-heap to efficiently find and remove the smallest and largest elements. This can help reduce the time complexity of your solution."

      "content": "After calculating all averages, you can find the minimum using a simple loop or by using a built-in function. Make sure to check if the averages list is empty before attempting to find the minimum."

      "content": "Finally, ensure your implementation handles the constraints properly. The number of elements is guaranteed to be even, and all values are within the specified range. This can simplify some of your checks."
