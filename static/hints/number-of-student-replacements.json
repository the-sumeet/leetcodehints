      "content": "Think about what it means for a student to be replaced. When a student is replaced, their score is no longer part of the array. How will you keep track of which scores have been replaced?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might count the number of replacements. You might want to maintain a count of how many times each score appears in the array. This could help you determine when a replacement occurs."
    },
    {
      "content": "You should also think about the order of scores. If two students have the same score, how will you handle that situation? Will the first student be replaced, or will it depend on some other criteria?"

      "content": "As you work through the problem, consider edge cases. For example, what happens if the input array is empty or contains only one score? How will your logic handle these scenarios?"

      "content": "Finally, think about the time complexity of your solution. If you are using nested loops, it might be inefficient for larger arrays. Can you optimize your approach to reduce the number of iterations?"
