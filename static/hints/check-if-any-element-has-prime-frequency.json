      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to determine if any element in the array has a frequency that is a prime number."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will count the frequency of each element in the array. A common approach is to use a dictionary or a hashmap to store the counts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the frequency of an element is simply how many times it appears in the array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 2, 3], the frequency of 2 is 2."

    {
      "content": "Next, think about how you can determine if a number is prime. A prime number is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself."

    {
      "content": "You might want to write a helper function that checks if a number is prime. This function could iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number to check for factors."
    },
    {
      "content": "After counting the frequencies, you will need to check each frequency to see if it is prime. You can do this by calling your prime-checking function for each frequency."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element. What is the frequency in that case, and is it prime?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where all elements have a frequency of 1. Remember, 1 is not a prime number."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The maximum length of the array is 100, and the values range from 0 to 100. This can help you optimize your solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, your function should return true if any frequency is prime and false otherwise. Make sure to test your implementation with the provided examples."
