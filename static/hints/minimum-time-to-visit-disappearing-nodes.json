      "content": "Think about how you would typically find the shortest path in a graph. Dijkstra's algorithm is a common choice for weighted graphs like this one. How would you adapt it to account for the disappearing nodes?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to track not only the minimum time to reach each node but also whether you can reach the node before it disappears. This means you need to compare the time it takes to reach a node with its disappearance time."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your algorithm, consider using a priority queue to efficiently get the next node to explore based on the shortest known distance. This will help you manage the nodes you have yet to visit."

    {
      "content": "When processing each node, check if the current time exceeds the disappearance time of that node. If it does, you should not consider that path further. This is crucial for nodes that disappear before you can reach them."

      "content": "Don't forget to initialize your answer array properly. Set the time for the starting node (node 0) to 0, and all other nodes to a placeholder value (like infinity) to indicate they are initially unreachable."
