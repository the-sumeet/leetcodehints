      "content": "Consider the requirement for unique integers. This means that once you use an even integer in your sum, you cannot use it again. Think about how you can generate a list of even integers without repetition."

      "content": "Recall that the sum of the first k even integers can be calculated. The sum of the first k even integers is given by the formula: sum = k * (k + 1). This will help you determine how many even integers you can use."

      "content": "When you are trying to maximize the number of unique even integers, you should start from the smallest even integer and keep adding the next even integer until you can no longer do so without exceeding finalSum."
