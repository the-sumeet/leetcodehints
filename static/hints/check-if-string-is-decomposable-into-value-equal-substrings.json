      "content": "Start by understanding what it means for a string to be decomposable into value-equal substrings. This means that you need to find substrings that are equal in value when interpreted as numbers. Consider how you would extract substrings from the original string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the string to identify potential substrings. You might want to consider using a nested loop to check every possible substring. For example, you can use two indices to define the start and end of a substring."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you extract a substring, remember to convert it to an integer to compare its value. Be cautious with leading zeros, as they can affect the numerical value. For instance, '001' should be treated as 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you extract substrings, keep track of their counts. You might want to use a dictionary or a counter to store how many times each unique substring appears. This will help you determine if you can form equal value groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the total length of the string and how it relates to the lengths of the substrings you are checking. If the total length isn't divisible by the number of unique substrings, it may not be possible to decompose the string as required."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, such as strings that are too short or consist of only one repeated character. For example, '111' can be decomposed into '1', '1', '1', but '000' cannot be decomposed into different value substrings."

    {
      "content": "Once you have your substrings and their counts, think about how to compare their values. You need to ensure that the sum of the values of the substrings matches the total value of the original string."

      "content": "Consider using a set to track the unique values of the substrings you have found. If all substrings have the same value, then you can conclude that the string is decomposable into value-equal substrings."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle cases where the string might have leading zeros or be empty. An empty string should return false, and a string of zeros should be handled carefully to ensure it meets the decomposition criteria."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you would return the result of your function. You need to return a boolean indicating whether the string can be decomposed into value-equal substrings. Make sure to test your function with various inputs to confirm its correctness."
