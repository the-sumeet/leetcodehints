      "content": "Remember that the string can have leading and trailing spaces. You might want to handle these spaces first to avoid counting them as part of the last word. Consider using string trimming functions."

      "content": "After trimming the string, think about how you can find the last word. You could split the string into an array of words based on spaces. What method can you use to get the last element of this array?"

      "content": "When splitting the string, keep in mind that multiple spaces between words should not create empty words in the array. How can you ensure that your splitting method handles this correctly?"

      "content": "As you iterate, you could check for spaces to determine when a word starts and ends. When you encounter a space after counting characters, that indicates the end of a word. What logic will you use to update your count?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to reverse your approach by starting from the end of the string. This way, you can skip any trailing spaces and directly count characters until you hit a space or the start of the string."

      "content": "Finally, when you find the last word, remember to return its length as the output. Ensure that your function adheres to the expected return format, which is simply an integer representing the length."
