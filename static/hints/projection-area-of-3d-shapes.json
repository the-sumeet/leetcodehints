    {
      "content": "For the xy-plane projection, simply count every cell in the grid that has a value greater than zero. This will give you the area of the shadow on the xy-plane."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, consider the projection onto the yz-plane. This projection is determined by the maximum height of cubes in each column. You can iterate through each column to find the maximum value."

      "content": "For the zx-plane projection, you need to find the maximum height for each row. Similar to the previous hint, iterate through each row to find the maximum value."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the case where a cell has a value of zero. This means that the projection area for that cell should not contribute to the total area."

      "content": "As you calculate the areas for each projection, keep a running total. You will end up with three separate values that you will need to sum for the final answer."

      "content": "Make sure to consider edge cases, such as when the grid is filled entirely with zeros. What would the projections look like in that case?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When summing the three projection areas, ensure you are not double-counting any areas. Each projection is distinct and should be treated separately."
    },
    {
      "content": "The final step is to return the total area as a single integer. Make sure your function's return type matches the expected output."

      "content": "You should now have a clear approach: count cells for the xy-plane, find max heights for yz and zx planes, and sum these values. Try implementing this step-by-step!"
