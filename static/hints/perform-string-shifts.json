      "content": "Consider how shifting works. For example, if you have the string 'abc' and you perform a left shift by 1, the result will be 'bca'. What happens if you shift right instead?"

      "content": "Think about how to handle multiple shifts. If you have several operations, you might want to combine them instead of applying them one by one. How can you calculate the net effect of all shifts?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that shifting a string can wrap around. For instance, shifting 'abc' left by 3 should return 'abc' again because it effectively completes a full cycle. How can you use modulo to simplify this?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the total shift, keep in mind the length of the string. If the total shift exceeds the length of the string, you can reduce it using the modulo operation. This will help avoid unnecessary full rotations."

    {
      "content": "You can represent the effective shift as a single integer. If you have a left shift of `k`, it can be represented as a negative shift for easier calculations. How can you convert both left and right shifts into a single effective shift value?"

    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your shifts, ensure you account for both directions correctly. If you have a left shift of `k` and a right shift of `m`, how do you compute the final effective shift?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, once you have the effective shift, you can construct the final string using slicing. For example, if the effective shift is `k`, you can do something like: `result = s[-k:] + s[:-k]`. Make sure to handle the case when `k` is zero."
