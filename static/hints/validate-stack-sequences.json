      "content": "Consider using a pointer for the `popped` array to track which element you are currently trying to pop. This will help you determine if the sequence of operations is valid."

      "content": "As you iterate through the `pushed` array, simulate the push operation by adding elements to a stack. After each push, check if the top of the stack matches the current element in the `popped` array."

      "content": "Implement a loop that continues until either the stack is empty or all elements in the `popped` array have been processed. This will help you manage the flow of push and pop operations."

      "content": "Remember to pop elements from the stack only when the top of the stack matches the current element in the `popped` array. If they match, pop the stack and move to the next element in `popped`."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: both `pushed` and `popped` contain distinct values and `popped` is a permutation of `pushed`. This means every value in `pushed` will appear exactly once in `popped`."
