      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints given in the problem. The maximum length of the array is 100,000, and each element can be as large as 1 billion. This means your solution should ideally be O(n) to handle the upper limits efficiently."

      "content": "You might want to use a loop that runs from 0 to n-1, where `n` is the length of the input array. Inside this loop, calculate the maximum and the score incrementally."
