      "content": "Consider the implications of the requirement that the sum of each column must be at most floor(k / 2), where k is the number of rows in your subset. This means that if you have k rows, the maximum number of 1's allowed in each column is k // 2."

      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the rows of the matrix. You might want to start with an empty list and gradually add rows while checking the conditions for being a good subset."

      "content": "To check if a subset of rows is good, you will need to maintain a count of 1's in each column as you add rows. How will you keep track of these counts efficiently?"
