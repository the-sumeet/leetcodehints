      "content": "Consider how you can use the spread operator (`...`) in JavaScript to handle a variable number of arguments. This will help you collect all arguments passed to your function."

      "content": "When dealing with placeholders, you might want to represent them with a specific value, such as an underscore (`_`). Make sure you can identify and handle these placeholders in your function."

      "content": "Think about how you can differentiate between actual values and placeholders in the arguments array. You may want to iterate through the arguments and check for the placeholder value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Your function should be able to replace placeholders with actual values from another array. Consider how you can map over the arguments and replace each placeholder with the corresponding value from the second array."

      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where there are more placeholders than provided values. What should your function return in such scenarios? Consider returning `undefined` or some default value for missing arguments."

      "content": "Think about the order of operations when replacing placeholders. You will need to keep track of which values from the second array have already been used to replace placeholders."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there are no placeholders at all. Your function should still return the original arguments in this case without any modifications."

      "content": "Remember that your function should return an array of arguments after processing. Ensure your return statement is structured correctly to output the final array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, put together all the pieces. You should have a function that takes two arrays: the first with placeholders and the second with values. Your goal is to return a new array where placeholders are replaced with corresponding values. Think about how you can implement this logic step by step."
