      "content": "Start by understanding what a 'valid split' means in the context of the problem. A valid split divides the array into subarrays such that each subarray meets certain conditions. Think about what conditions would make a subarray valid."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the properties of the subarrays. What characteristics do they need to have? For instance, do they need to be of a certain length, or do they need to contain specific values? Try to identify these properties."
    },
    {
      "content": "Examine the input array closely. Are there any patterns or properties that you can leverage? For example, are there any repeating numbers or sequences that could help you in forming valid subarrays?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you might iterate through the array to find potential splits. A good approach could be to use a nested loop to check every possible split point. Consider how you would keep track of the minimum number of subarrays formed."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking for valid subarrays, consider edge cases such as arrays with only one element or all elements being the same. How would these cases affect your logic for determining valid splits?"

      "content": "You might want to maintain a count of valid subarrays as you iterate through the array. Consider using a variable to track the number of valid splits you find. How will you update this count?"

      "content": "Think about how to optimize your solution. A brute force approach might work, but it could be inefficient. Are there any data structures or algorithms that could help you reduce the number of checks needed?"
    },
    {
      "content": "As you refine your approach, consider how to handle ties. If multiple splits yield the same number of subarrays, how will you decide which one to choose? This could involve keeping track of the indices of the splits."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, make sure to test it with various edge cases. For instance, what happens with an empty array, or an array with all unique elements? Ensure your solution handles these gracefully."

      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the result. The problem asks for the minimum number of subarrays in a valid split. Make sure your return statement reflects this requirement clearly."
