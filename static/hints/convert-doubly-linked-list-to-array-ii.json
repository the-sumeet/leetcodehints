      "content": "Consider how you would traverse a doubly linked list. You can start from the head node and move to the next node using the 'next' pointer. Think about how you can collect values as you traverse."

      "content": "Pay attention to the stopping condition for your traversal. You should continue traversing until you reach a node that is null (i.e., the end of the list). This is crucial to avoid accessing invalid memory."
