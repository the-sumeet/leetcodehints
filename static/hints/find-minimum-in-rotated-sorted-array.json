      "content": "As you perform the binary search, compare the middle element with the rightmost element. This will help you determine which half of the array is sorted and where to search next. What can you infer if the middle element is greater than the rightmost element?"

      "content": "If the middle element is less than the rightmost element, it indicates that the minimum must be in the left half, including the middle element. Conversely, if the middle element is greater, the minimum must be in the right half. How would you adjust your pointers based on these comparisons?"
