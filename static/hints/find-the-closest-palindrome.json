      "content": "After generating potential palindrome candidates, sort them by their absolute difference from the input number. This will help you easily find the closest one."

      "content": "Remember to convert your final result back to a string before returning it, as the problem specifies that the output should be a string."

    {
      "content": "As a final touch, ensure your function handles the maximum constraints of the problem, especially since the input can be as large as 10^18."
