    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints given in the problem. The length of the array is between 2 and 10^4, and each number in the array is between 1 and 10^4. This means you need an efficient solution, ideally O(n) time complexity."

      "content": "As you iterate through the array, keep a count of each number you encounter. If you find a number that you have seen before, thatâ€™s your duplicate. You can use a simple array to count occurrences."
