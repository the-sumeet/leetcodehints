      "content": "Focus on the `FriendRequest` data first. You need to keep track of how many requests each user sent. Consider using a dictionary to count requests for each user."

      "content": "Next, look at the `RequestAccepted` data. Similar to the previous step, you should count how many requests each user accepted. Again, a dictionary can be useful for this."
