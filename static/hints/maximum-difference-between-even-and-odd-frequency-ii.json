      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to find a substring of at least length `k` where one character has an odd frequency and another has a non-zero even frequency."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will extract substrings from the string `s`. You can use a sliding window approach to efficiently manage the substring size and character frequencies."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you will need to keep track of the frequencies of characters in the current substring. A frequency array or dictionary can help you with this."

    {
      "content": "When examining a substring, ensure that you check all characters to find one with an odd frequency and another with an even frequency."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently update the frequencies as you move your sliding window. You will need to add the new character and remove the old character as the window slides."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where the current substring has fewer than `k` characters. You can skip those substrings."

    {
      "content": "While iterating, keep track of the maximum difference you find between the odd frequency character and the even frequency character."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all characters have the same frequency or when there are no valid characters meeting the odd/even criteria."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you find a valid pair of frequencies (odd and even), compute the difference and update your maximum difference if this one is larger."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem guarantees at least one valid substring exists, so you won't need to handle cases where no valid pairs are found."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: the string length can be up to 30,000, so your solution should be efficient, ideally O(n) or O(n log n)."

    {
      "content": "You might want to use a set to keep track of characters with odd and even frequencies as you iterate through the substring."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using two nested loops: the outer loop for the starting index of the substring and the inner loop for the ending index, ensuring the length is at least `k`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you check frequencies, remember that you need to differentiate between characters with odd and even frequencies. You can use modulo operations for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, test it with edge cases such as strings with only two distinct characters or strings where all characters are the same."
