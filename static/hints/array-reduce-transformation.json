      "content": "Start by understanding the purpose of the reducer function `fn`. It takes two parameters: an accumulator (`init` or the result from the previous operation) and the current element from the array. Your task is to apply this function sequentially across all elements in `nums`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle the initial value. If the array `nums` is empty, you should return `init` directly. This is a crucial edge case to check before processing any elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you will iterate through the `nums` array. You can use a simple `for` loop to access each element one by one. Remember to keep track of the current value of the accumulator as you process each element."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, you'll need to update the accumulator with the result of calling `fn` on it and the current element. Make sure to correctly pass these values to `fn` in each iteration."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the order of operations is important. You should always apply `fn` to the accumulator first, followed by the current element from the array. This ensures that each step builds on the previous result."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints given in the problem. The length of `nums` can be zero, and the values of `nums` and `init` are bounded between 0 and 1000. This can help you optimize your solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where `fn` might produce unexpected results. For example, if `fn` always returns a constant value, your final result will reflect that. Test different functions to ensure your solution is robust."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your implementation with various inputs, including edge cases like an empty array, arrays with one element, and large arrays. This will help you confirm that your logic is sound."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you implement your loop, initialize a variable to hold the current value of the accumulator before the loop starts. Update this variable in each iteration with the result of `fn`."

    {
      "content": "Finally, after processing all elements in `nums`, return the value of the accumulator. This will be the final result of your reducer function applied to the array."
