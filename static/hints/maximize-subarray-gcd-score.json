      "content": "Consider how the doubling operation affects the GCD of a subarray. Doubling an element can only increase its value, potentially increasing the GCD of the subarray it belongs to. Think about how this might change the score."

      "content": "Remember that you can only double each element once and you have a limited number of operations (k). This means you need to be strategic about which elements to double. How might you choose which elements to double?"

      "content": "GCD has properties that can simplify your calculations. For example, GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(GCD(a, b), c). This means you can build the GCD incrementally as you expand or contract your window."
