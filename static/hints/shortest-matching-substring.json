      "content": "Consider how the '*' characters divide the pattern `p` into three parts: the substring before the first '*', the substring between the two '*', and the substring after the second '*'."

      "content": "Think about how you can find the first part of `p` in `s`. You can use a simple search method to locate the starting index of the first substring that matches the part before the first '*'."

    {
      "content": "Once you find the first part, remember that the substring after the first '*' can be matched by any sequence of characters. Focus on finding the second part of `p` after the first '*' has been matched."

    {
      "content": "After matching the first part, you will need to find the second part of `p` after the second '*'. This means you will need to continue searching in `s` from the position where the first part ended."

      "content": "Consider using two pointers or indices: one to track where you are in `s` and another to track your position in `p`. This will help you manage the matching process effectively."

      "content": "Don't forget that the '*' can match zero characters. This means that if the part before the first '*' can be matched at the start of `s`, you should also consider this case."
