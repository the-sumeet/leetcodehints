    {
      "content": "Consider the range of numbers from 0 to n. You need to check each number's binary representation for consecutive ones. However, this approach can be inefficient, especially for large n."

    {
      "content": "Instead of checking each number individually, think about how many valid binary numbers can be formed with a certain number of bits. This can help you avoid checking each number one by one."
    },
    {
      "content": "Recall that the Fibonacci sequence can be related to the number of valid binary representations without consecutive ones. For example, if you have k bits, the number of valid representations can be derived from the previous two counts."

      "content": "Define a function that calculates the number of valid binary numbers with a specific length. This function will help you build up to the solution without checking every single number."

    {
      "content": "When handling numbers with the same number of bits as n, pay attention to the most significant bit. If the most significant bit is 1, you can choose to set the next bit to 0 or 1, but you need to ensure no consecutive ones."

      "content": "Use dynamic programming to keep track of the counts of valid numbers based on the number of bits. You can create an array where each index represents the count of valid numbers for that bit length."

      "content": "After processing all bits of n, ensure you add the count of valid numbers formed by the bits processed so far. This will give you the total count of valid numbers up to n."
