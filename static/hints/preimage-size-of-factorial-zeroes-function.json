      "content": "Start by understanding how to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial. Recall that trailing zeroes are produced by factors of 10, which are made from pairs of 2 and 5. Since there are generally more factors of 2 than 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to x."

    {
      "content": "To compute the number of trailing zeroes, you can use the formula: f(x) = x // 5 + x // 25 + x // 125 + ... until x // 5^n is zero. This counts how many multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc., are in the range from 1 to x."
