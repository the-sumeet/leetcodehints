      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the graph. You have nodes and edges, where each edge has a weight. The goal is to minimize the maximum weight of edges in any connected component after potentially removing some edges."

    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the integer k. It represents the maximum number of connected components allowed after edge removals. If k is equal to n, you can remove all edges, resulting in each node being its own component with a cost of 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how the maximum edge weight influences the overall cost of a component. The cost of a component is defined as the maximum weight of edges within it. This means if you can remove high-weight edges, you can potentially lower the maximum cost."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to sort the edges based on their weights. This will help you consider which edges to remove first when trying to minimize the maximum component cost. Sorting can be done in O(E log E) time."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a binary search approach on the maximum edge weight. The idea is to check if it is possible to partition the graph into at most k components such that the maximum edge weight in any component does not exceed a certain value."

    {
      "content": "For each candidate maximum weight during your binary search, you can use a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to efficiently manage and merge components. This will help you determine how many components you can form without exceeding the candidate weight."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the union-find structure, remember to include path compression and union by rank to optimize the operations. This will ensure that your solution runs efficiently even for larger graphs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when there are no edges at all (edges.length = 0). In this case, each node is its own component, and the maximum cost would be 0 regardless of k."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where k is 1 carefully. In this scenario, you cannot remove any edges, and the maximum cost will be the maximum weight of any edge in the original graph."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your binary search checks the feasibility of forming components correctly. If you can form more than k components with the current maximum weight, you need to adjust your search range accordingly."
