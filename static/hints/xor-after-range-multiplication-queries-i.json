    {
      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input. You have an array `nums` and a list of `queries`. Each query specifies a range in `nums` and involves multiplication of elements within that range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the parameters of each query: `l`, `r`, `k`, and `v`. They dictate the starting index, ending index, step size, and the value to multiply by, respectively. Make sure to correctly interpret these values."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the multiplication operation is followed by a modulo operation with `10^9 + 7`. This is crucial to prevent overflow and to ensure that the results fit within the specified limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing each query, you will iterate from index `l` to `r` using the step size `k`. This means you will not visit every index in the range, only those that are spaced by `k`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where `l` and `r` are the same. In this case, you only need to update a single element in the `nums` array. Ensure your loop handles this correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "After processing all queries, you need to compute the bitwise XOR of all elements in the modified `nums` array. Remember that XOR is both commutative and associative, which can simplify your calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently handle the updates to `nums`. Directly modifying the array in place is one approach, but consider how this affects performance if there are many queries."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the modulo operation within the loop correctly. Each multiplication should be followed by the modulo operation to ensure values remain within bounds."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the solution, keep track of the indices you are updating. Use a loop with the correct bounds and step size to avoid any off-by-one errors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, after all queries have been processed, implement the XOR calculation. You can initialize a variable to zero and iterate through `nums`, applying XOR for each element."
