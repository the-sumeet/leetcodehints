    {
      "content": "Consider how you can iterate through the array of words. You might want to use a loop to access each word and extract its first character. Remember, the first character can typically be accessed using indexing, like `word[0]`."

      "content": "As you extract the first characters, think about how you can concatenate them into a single string. You could initialize an empty string and append each first character to it during your iteration."

      "content": "Don't forget to check the length of the string `s` compared to the number of words. If `s` is longer than the number of words, it can't be an acronym, so you can immediately return false."
