    {
      "content": "Consider what happens after completing a transaction. Your money decreases by the cost of the transaction and increases by the cashback. This means that the net effect of a transaction is (cashback - cost)."

    {
      "content": "Think about the worst-case scenario. If you perform a transaction that has a high cost and low cashback first, you might run out of money. Therefore, you need to ensure that you have enough money to cover the highest cost transaction at any point."

      "content": "To find the minimum starting money, you might want to track the cumulative effect of transactions as you process them in a specific order. This could help you identify the lowest point your money can reach."
