      "content": "When implementing your search, be careful to avoid revisiting cells in the same path. You can use a visited set or a memoization technique to store results of previously computed paths."

      "content": "Think about the base case for your recursion or dynamic programming. If you reach a cell where no further moves are possible, you should return the count of moves made so far."
