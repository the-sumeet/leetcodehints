      "content": "Start by understanding how to convert an integer to its binary representation. You can use built-in functions in many programming languages to achieve this. For example, in Python, you can use `bin(n)` to get the binary string of `n`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the binary representation, remember that the complement involves flipping each bit. This means changing '0's to '1's and '1's to '0's. Think about how you might iterate through the binary string to perform this operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle the binary string. You can create a new string to store the flipped bits. For each character in the binary string, check if it's '0' or '1' and append the opposite to your new string."
    },
    {
      "content": "After obtaining the complement in binary form, you'll need to convert it back to a decimal (base-10) integer. In Python, you can use `int(complement_string, 2)` to convert a binary string back to an integer."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. For example, what happens when `n` is `0`? Make sure your solution handles this case correctly, as the binary representation of `0` is just '0'."

    {
      "content": "Remember the constraints: `0 <= n < 10^9`. This means you won't have to deal with negative numbers or very large integers beyond this range. Ensure your solution is efficient within these limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the length of the binary representation. The complement of a number will have the same number of bits as the original number. This means if `n` is `5`, which is '101', its complement will also have 3 bits."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can also think about using bitwise operations to find the complement. For example, you can use the XOR operator with a mask that has all bits set to 1 for the length of `n`'s binary representation."
    },
    {
      "content": "To create the mask, you can find the highest power of 2 that is greater than `n`. This can be done using bit manipulation. For instance, you can keep shifting `1` to the left until it exceeds `n`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, combine your understanding of binary representation, bitwise operations, and conversion functions to implement your solution. The final step involves XORing `n` with the mask to get the complement."
