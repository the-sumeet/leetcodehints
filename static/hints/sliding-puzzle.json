      "content": "Think about the possible moves. The empty space (0) can swap with any of its adjacent tiles (up, down, left, right). Identify the indices of the empty space to determine which tiles can be swapped."

      "content": "As you implement BFS, maintain a queue to track the current board state and the number of moves taken to reach that state. You can also use a set to avoid revisiting states you've already processed."

    {
      "content": "To determine if a board configuration is solvable, you can calculate the number of inversions. An inversion is a pair of tiles (a,b) such that a appears before b but a > b. If the number of inversions is odd, the puzzle is unsolvable."
