    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to identify characters that repeat within a substring. For instance, in the string 'abab', the substrings 'ab' and 'ba' are valid, but 'abab' itself is not because it contains repeating characters."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the string to generate substrings. A simple way is to use two nested loops: the outer loop for the starting index and the inner loop for the ending index of the substring."

    {
      "content": "As you generate substrings, maintain a set or a dictionary to track characters that have already been seen. This will help you quickly check if a character is repeating."

    {
      "content": "When you find a repeating character, you need to stop counting that substring and move your starting index. Consider using a sliding window approach to efficiently manage the start and end of your substring."

      "content": "Make sure to account for edge cases, such as an empty string or a string where all characters are the same. For example, an empty string should return 0, while 'aaa' should also return 3 for the substrings 'a', 'a', and 'a'."

      "content": "Think about how you can keep track of the count of valid substrings. You could increment a counter each time you find a new valid substring that does not contain repeating characters."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to reset your tracking structure (like the set or dictionary) when you move your starting index to ensure you're only checking the current substring."

      "content": "Finally, think about how to return the total count of valid substrings. You might want to return an integer that represents this count, ensuring that you have handled all edge cases correctly."
