      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of a tree. A tree with n nodes has exactly n-1 edges, and it is a connected graph with no cycles. Each node can be thought of as a component, and removing edges can split the tree into multiple components."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to calculate the value of a component. The value of a component is the sum of the values of all nodes it contains. You will need to traverse the tree to gather these values, which can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS)."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the condition for a valid split. A split is valid if the sum of the values in each resulting component is divisible by k. This means you need to check the sum of each component after you remove edges."
    },
    {
      "content": "When removing an edge, it effectively separates the tree into two parts. You'll want to consider how to efficiently check if each part's sum is divisible by k after an edge is removed."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you traverse the tree, keep track of the cumulative sum of values. You can use a DFS to compute the sum for each subtree rooted at a node. This will help you determine if removing an edge leads to valid components."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the sum of all node values is guaranteed to be divisible by k. This means that if you can find a subtree whose sum is divisible by k, the rest of the tree will also form a valid component when that edge is removed."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to maintain a count of how many valid components you can form as you explore the tree. Each time you find a subtree with a sum divisible by k, you can increment your count of components."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the tree has only one node. In this case, the only component is the node itself, and you need to check if its value is divisible by k."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the values of nodes. If all values are less than k, it may be impossible to form any valid components unless the sum of the entire tree is divisible by k."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your DFS, be careful about the order of operations. You should compute the sum for a node before returning from the recursive call to ensure you have the correct subtree sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to use a helper function to perform the DFS and return both the sum of the current subtree and the count of valid components found."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you remove edges, think about how to avoid counting the same component multiple times. You should only count a component once when you determine it meets the divisibility condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the performance of your solution. Since n can be as large as 30,000, ensure that your approach runs in linear time, O(n), to handle the largest cases efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various edge cases, such as trees that are essentially linear, trees with all nodes having the same value, and trees where every node has a value of zero."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to return the maximum number of components. You should ensure that your function returns this count after processing all potential edge removals."
