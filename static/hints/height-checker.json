    {
      "content": "Start by understanding the problem. You need to compare two arrays: the current heights and the expected heights. The expected heights will be sorted in non-decreasing order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can generate the expected array from the heights array. You can use a sorting function to create this expected array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the expected array will be the same length as the heights array. So, ensure your sorting method maintains the original size."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have both arrays (heights and expected), you will need to iterate through them to find the indices where they differ."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a loop to compare each element of the heights array with the corresponding element in the expected array. You can use a counter to keep track of the differences."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you loop through the arrays, you can use a simple condition: if heights[i] != expected[i], increment your counter."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the heights array has only one element. What should the output be in that case?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The heights values range from 1 to 100, and the length of the array is between 1 and 100. How does this affect your solution?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, consider the time complexity of your approach. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), and comparing the arrays takes O(n). Is this efficient enough given the constraints?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your function returns the correct count of mismatched indices. You should return this count as an integer."
