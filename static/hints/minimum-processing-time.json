      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the problem. You have a number of processors, each with 4 cores, and you need to assign tasks to these cores. Remember that each task takes a certain amount of time to complete."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the processors' availability affects the completion time. Each processor has a specific time when it becomes available, and you need to factor this into your calculations when assigning tasks."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to pair tasks with processors. Since each processor can take 4 tasks, you will need to explore combinations of tasks that can be assigned to each processor."
    },
    {
      "content": "The completion time for each processor will be determined by the maximum time taken by any of the tasks assigned to it. This means you'll need to calculate the finish time for each processor based on the tasks assigned."
    },
    {
      "content": "When assigning tasks to processors, ensure that you account for the time each processor becomes available. The finish time for a task assigned to a processor is its available time plus the task duration."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since the number of tasks is exactly four times the number of processors, you can use combinations to generate all possible groupings of tasks. This will help you evaluate different ways to assign tasks to processors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be mindful of the constraints. You have up to 25,000 processors and tasks can be as large as 100,000. This suggests that a brute-force approach may not be feasible due to performance considerations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a priority queue or a greedy approach to efficiently manage the assignment of tasks to processors. This can help minimize the overall completion time by always assigning tasks to the most available processor."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you work through potential solutions, remember to keep track of the maximum finish time across all processors. This will be your final answer, as you need the overall minimum time to complete all tasks."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to start by sorting the tasks and processors to facilitate easier assignment and calculation of finish times. Think about how sorting can help you make more optimal decisions."
