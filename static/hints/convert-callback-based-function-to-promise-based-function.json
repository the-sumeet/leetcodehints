      "content": "Remember that a promise represents a value that may be available now, or in the future, or never. You will need to create a new Promise object and resolve or reject it based on the callback's behavior."

    {
      "content": "Look at how the callback is invoked. If the callback is called with a single value, you will resolve the promise with that value. If it is called with an error message or a second argument, you should reject the promise."

      "content": "When creating the promise, you should define the executor function that will handle the logic of calling the callback and resolving or rejecting the promise based on its output."

      "content": "Consider how you will return the promise from your function. The function should return the new promise so that it can be used with `.then()` and `.catch()` methods."
