      "content": "Start by understanding the problem of calculating the distance from a point to the origin. The Euclidean distance formula for a point (x, y) is given by: \n\n\\[ d = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \\]\n\nHowever, since we only need to compare distances, you can work with the squared distance to avoid unnecessary square root calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might represent the distance for each point in the array. You could create a new list where each entry is a tuple containing the squared distance and the corresponding point. For example:\n\n\\[ (x^2 + y^2, [x, y]) \\]"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to sort the points based on their distance. You can use Python's built-in sorting capabilities, which allow you to sort by the first element of the tuple (the squared distance). Remember that sorting is O(n log n) complexity."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before sorting, ensure you handle the case where k is equal to the number of points. In such cases, you would simply return all the points without needing to sort them."

      "content": "When you sort the list of points by distance, you can then easily slice the first k elements from this sorted list to get your answer. In Python, this can be done using list slicing: `sorted_points[:k]`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where all points are at the same distance from the origin. The problem guarantees unique answers, but the order of points in the output does not matter. This means any k points that are closest will be acceptable."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind the constraints of the problem. You are given that 1 <= k <= points.length <= 10^4, which means your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of input size."

      "content": "When implementing your solution, think about how you can encapsulate the distance calculation and sorting in a clean function. This will help keep your main logic clear and focused."

    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure your output is formatted correctly. You should return the k closest points as a list of lists. For example, if your closest points are stored in a variable `closest_points`, you would return `closest_points` directly."

      "content": "To summarize your approach: Calculate the squared distance for each point, sort the points based on this distance, and return the first k points. Remember to handle any potential edge cases as discussed."
