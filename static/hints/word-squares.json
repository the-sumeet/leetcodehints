      "content": "Start by understanding what a word square is. A word square is a set of words that form a square grid, where the words read the same horizontally and vertically."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the length of the words in the input list. All words must be of the same length to form a valid square. What happens if the list contains words of varying lengths?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can build the word square incrementally. You might want to start with an empty square and add one word at a time, checking for validity as you go."
    },
    {
      "content": "When adding a new word to the square, ensure that it matches the existing words in the corresponding positions. This means checking the first character of the new word against the first character of the first word already in the square."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using backtracking to explore potential word squares. If adding a word leads to a dead end, you should be able to backtrack and try a different word."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a trie (prefix tree) to efficiently check if a word can be formed at each step. This can help you quickly determine if the next word can continue the square."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the base case for your recursive function. When do you know you've successfully formed a word square? This will typically be when the square is filled completely."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when the input list is empty or contains fewer words than needed to form a square."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the word square. A 2D list (or array) might be a good choice. How would you access elements in this structure?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking for valid words to add, you might want to use a set for quick lookups. This can help you avoid duplicates and speed up your checks."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you build the square, keep track of the current row and column. This will help you know where to place the next word and how to validate it against the existing words."

    {
      "content": "Think about the output format. Are you required to return all possible word squares, or just one? How will you structure your return value?"
    },
    {
      "content": "You might need to sort the input list of words or filter them based on certain criteria (like length) before starting the construction of the word square."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the time complexity of your approach. If you're using backtracking, how can you optimize your search to avoid unnecessary computations?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, remember to test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases, to ensure it handles all scenarios correctly. What would happen with a single word or with words that cannot form a square?"
