      "content": "What happens if a string contains the delimiter you choose? You need to ensure that your encoding method can handle such cases. Think about how you can escape or encode the delimiter within the strings."

      "content": "When you encode the list of strings, you should create a single string as the output. Think about how you can concatenate the strings with a chosen delimiter. For example, if your delimiter is '|', you could do something like: `encoded = string1 + '|' + string2 + '|' + ...`."

      "content": "For decoding, you'll need to split the encoded string back into the original list of strings. Remember to use the same delimiter you used for encoding. You can use a function like `split('|')` to achieve this."
