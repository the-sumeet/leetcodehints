      "content": "As you find each `1`, keep track of its index. You can use a variable to store the index of the last `1` you encountered. This will help you calculate the distance to the next `1`."

      "content": "Remember that the distance between two `1`s is calculated as the difference between their indices. If you find two `1`s, check if the difference is at least `k`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where there are no `1`s in the array. In such cases, the function should return `true` since there are no violations of the distance condition."

      "content": "Think about what happens if `k` is `0`. In this case, any configuration of `1`s should return `true` since they are considered to be 'at least 0 places away' from each other."
