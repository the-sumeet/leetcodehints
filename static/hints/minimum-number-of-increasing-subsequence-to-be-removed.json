    {
      "content": "Consider what an increasing subsequence is. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each element is larger than the previous one. For example, in the array [5, 3, 1, 4, 2], [1, 4] is an increasing subsequence."

      "content": "Think about how you can identify increasing subsequences in the array. You might want to use a dynamic programming approach or a greedy algorithm."

      "content": "What happens if the array is already non-increasing? For example, in the case of [5, 4, 3, 2, 1], you wouldn't need to remove any subsequences."

      "content": "Remember that you need to minimize the number of subsequences removed. This suggests that you might need to find the longest increasing subsequence first."

    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the longest increasing subsequence, you can compute the minimum number of subsequences to remove by subtracting the length of this subsequence from the total number of elements."
