      "content": "You can iterate through the array to find the first and last indices of the first and last colors. For example, if the first house has color 'A', find the last index of any house with a different color."

      "content": "Make sure to use the absolute value function to ensure the distance is always positive. This is crucial since the distance is defined as abs(i - j)."
