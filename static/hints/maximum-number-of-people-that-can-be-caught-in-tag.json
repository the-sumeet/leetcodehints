      "content": "Consider the meaning of the integer input, which represents the maximum distance a person can run away from the tagger. This distance will affect how many people can be tagged. Think about how this distance interacts with the positions of the 1s in the array."

      "content": "Visualize the problem with a simple example. For instance, in the array [0,1,0,1,0] with a distance of 3, think about how far the tagger can reach from their position. How does that affect the people represented by 1s?"
