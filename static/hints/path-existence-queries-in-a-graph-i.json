You need to create edges between nodes based on the absolute difference of their corresponding values in the `nums` array.

      "content": "Make sure to analyze the time complexity of your approach. The constraints allow for up to 100,000 nodes and queries, so your solution should ideally be close to O(n log n) or O(n) for the main operations."
