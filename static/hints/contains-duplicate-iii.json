      "content": "Remember that you also need to check the absolute difference between the values of nums at these indices. Specifically, abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) must be less than or equal to valueDiff."

      "content": "As you iterate through the array, keep track of the numbers you have seen so far within the allowed indexDiff range. A data structure like a set or a balanced tree could be useful."
