      "content": "Start by understanding what a bitwise AND operation is. The bitwise AND of two numbers results in a number where each bit is set to 1 only if both corresponding bits of the operands are also 1. For example, `5 & 3` results in `1` because in binary, `5` is `101` and `3` is `011`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the maximum value in the array `nums`. This value will be the target for the bitwise AND since we are looking for subarrays that have the maximum possible AND value. Use a simple loop to find this maximum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the maximum value, your next step is to find all contiguous subarrays that consist only of this maximum value. Remember, a subarray is defined as a continuous segment of the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to check for segments of the maximum value. You can maintain a count of the current length of the segment while traversing through the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you encounter an element that is equal to the maximum value, increment your current segment length. If you encounter an element that is not equal, compare the current segment length with the longest found so far and reset the current length."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to check the length of the last segment after you finish iterating through the array. Itâ€™s possible the longest segment is at the end of the array."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are the same. These cases can help ensure your solution is robust."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the constraints given in the problem. The size of the array can be up to 100,000, so aim for a solution that runs in linear time, O(n)."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your logic, keep track of the maximum AND value found and the longest length of subarrays that match this value. You can use two variables for this purpose."
