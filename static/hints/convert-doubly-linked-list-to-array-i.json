      "content": "Think about how you will traverse the doubly linked list. You will need to start from the head node and move through the list using the next pointers until you reach the end (where the next pointer is null)."

      "content": "As you traverse the list, you should collect the values of each node. Consider using an array (or a list) to store these values as you go. Remember to initialize your array before starting the traversal."

      "content": "Pay attention to the order in which you collect the values. You should add the value of the current node to the array before moving to the next node. This ensures that the order of elements in the array matches their order in the linked list."
