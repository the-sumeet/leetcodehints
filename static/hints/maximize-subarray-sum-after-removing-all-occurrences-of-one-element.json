      "content": "Think about how removing an integer affects the subarray sums. You want to evaluate the maximum sum for the original array first, as this will be a baseline for your comparisons."

      "content": "Finally, remember to return the maximum subarray sum as your result. Ensure your function handles all edge cases and returns the correct value."
