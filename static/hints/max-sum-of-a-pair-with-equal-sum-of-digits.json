      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the sum of digits for a number. A simple way to do this is to repeatedly divide the number by 10 and sum the remainders. For example, for `num = 18`, the sum of digits is `1 + 8 = 9`."

      "content": "Think about how you can group numbers by their digit sums. You could use a dictionary (or hashmap) where the key is the digit sum and the value is a list of numbers that have that digit sum. This will help you find pairs efficiently."
