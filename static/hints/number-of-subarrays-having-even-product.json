      "content": "You can use two nested loops to generate subarrays. The outer loop can fix the starting index, while the inner loop can extend the subarray to the end of the array. For example:\n\n```\nfor start in range(len(arr)):\n    for end in range(start, len(arr)):\n        subarray = arr[start:end + 1]\n```\n"
