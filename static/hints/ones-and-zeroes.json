    {
      "content": "Consider how to count the number of '0's and '1's in each string. You might want to create a helper function that takes a binary string and returns the count of '0's and '1's. For example:\n\n```python\ndef count_zeros_ones(s):\n    return s.count('0'), s.count('1')\n```"

      "content": "Initialize your DP table with zeros. The dimensions of the table should be `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` to account for all possible counts of '0's and '1's from 0 up to `m` and `n` respectively."
