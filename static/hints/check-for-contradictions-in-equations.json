      "content": "Think about how to build the graph. For each equation like ['a', 'b'] with a value of 3, you would create two edges: one from 'a' to 'b' with a weight of 3, and one from 'b' to 'a' with a weight of 1/3."

      "content": "Remember to handle cases where the same variable appears in multiple equations. You will need to ensure that the graph can accommodate all relationships without contradictions."

    {
      "content": "As you build the graph, consider how you will check for contradictions. A cycle in the graph could indicate a contradiction if the product of the weights in the cycle does not equal 1."
