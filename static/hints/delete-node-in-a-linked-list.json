      "content": "Remember that you are given a pointer to the node you want to delete, not the head of the list. This means you can't traverse the list from the beginning; you can only work with the given node and its neighbors."

      "content": "Since the node to be deleted is guaranteed not to be the last node, you can safely copy the value from the next node into the current node you want to delete. This will effectively 'overwrite' the current node's value."

      "content": "After copying the value from the next node, you need to adjust the pointers. Specifically, you should set the current node's next pointer to skip the next node, thus removing it from the list."
