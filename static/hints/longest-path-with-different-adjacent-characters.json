      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the tree. The `parent` array provides the relationship between nodes, where `parent[i]` indicates the parent of node `i`. This means that you can represent the tree using an adjacency list."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since the tree is rooted at node 0, you can build an adjacency list to represent the tree. For each node `i`, add `i` to the list of its parent's children. This will help you traverse the tree easily."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, think about how to traverse the tree. A depth-first search (DFS) is a good approach here, as it allows you to explore each branch fully before backtracking."
    },
    {
      "content": "While traversing, keep track of the length of the current path. You need to ensure that adjacent nodes in the path have different characters. Use the string `s` to check this condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a recursive function for your DFS. The function can take the current node and the length of the current path as parameters. This will help you build the path length dynamically."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you visit a child node, check if its character is different from its parent’s character. If it is, you can increment the path length; otherwise, you should reset the path length."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to keep track of the maximum path length found during your DFS. You can use a global variable or pass it around as a parameter to update it when you find a longer path."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there is only one node in the tree. In this case, the longest path would be 0 since there are no edges."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where all characters are the same. In this scenario, the longest path would also be 1, since you cannot have any adjacent nodes with different characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your DFS, ensure that you are not revisiting nodes. Since it’s a tree, you won’t have cycles, but be cautious about how you manage your visited nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "After completing the DFS, you should have the maximum length of the path stored. Make sure to return this value as the final result of your function."
    },
    {
      "content": "Double-check the constraints given in the problem. The number of nodes can be as large as 100,000, so your solution should be efficient, ideally O(n)."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will handle the input format. The `parent` array and the string `s` should be of the same length, which represents the number of nodes in the tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various cases, including trees with varying structures and character distributions. This will help ensure your solution is robust."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, you may want to optimize your DFS by using memoization if you find that you are recalculating paths for the same nodes repeatedly. This can help improve performance."

    "The tree is represented by a parent array where parent[0] == -1.",
    "The string s must have the same length as the parent array.",
    "The solution should return the length of the longest path, not the path itself.",
    "The path length is defined by the number of edges, not the number of nodes."
