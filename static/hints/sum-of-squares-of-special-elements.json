    {
      "content": "Remember that the array is 1-indexed. This means that the first element is at index 1, the second element at index 2, and so on. Be careful when accessing elements in the array."

      "content": "To find special elements, you need to check each index from 1 to n. Use a loop to iterate through these indices and check if n % i == 0."

      "content": "As you identify special indices, keep track of the corresponding elements in the nums array. You will need to access nums[i-1] for the 0-indexed array."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the array has only one element. In this case, the only index is 1, which will always be special, and you should return the square of that single element."

      "content": "Think about performance: since n is at most 50, a straightforward approach with a loop will be efficient enough. You won't need to optimize further."
