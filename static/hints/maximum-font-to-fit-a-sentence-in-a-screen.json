      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to find the maximum font size from a list that allows the given sentence to fit within a specified width. Make sure to note how the font size affects the width of the rendered text."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the width of the text is calculated based on the font size. If each character has a width of 1 unit per font size, then the total width for a sentence can be calculated as: `width = font_size * length_of_sentence`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the list of font sizes. You might want to check each font size in descending order to find the maximum that fits the width constraint."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before checking each font size, ensure you have the correct length of the sentence. You can use the `len()` function in Python to get the length easily."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle cases where the font sizes are not sorted. You may want to sort the font sizes in descending order first to simplify your search for the maximum font size that fits."

    {
      "content": "When checking if a font size fits, use the formula mentioned earlier. If `font_size * length_of_sentence <= width`, then the font size fits. Otherwise, it doesn't."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the sentence is empty or the width is zero. What should the function return in these cases? Think about how these scenarios affect your logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to account for the possibility of multiple font sizes fitting the width. Your solution should return the largest font size that fits, so keep track of the maximum found during your iteration."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider using a loop to check each font size and a variable to store the maximum font size that fits. You can initialize this variable to a default value, like zero."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct value. If no font sizes fit, you might want to return an indication of that, such as -1 or 0, based on your design choice."
