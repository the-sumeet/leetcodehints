      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to repeatedly concatenate the first and last elements of the array until it's empty. Make sure you grasp how concatenation works in this context."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will access the first and last elements of the array. In a 0-indexed array, the first element is at index 0 and the last element is at index `len(nums) - 1`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to concatenate two numbers in Python. You can convert them to strings, concatenate those strings, and then convert the result back to an integer. For example: `int(str(first) + str(last))`."

      "content": "What happens when the array has only one element left? You should add that single element's value to the concatenation value and then remove it. Make sure to handle this case separately."

    {
      "content": "As you perform operations, remember to remove the elements you've processed. You can use the `pop()` method to remove elements from the end of the list, and `del` or `pop(0)` to remove from the start."

      "content": "Remember to initialize your concatenation value to 0 before starting the operations. This will store the cumulative result as you process the array."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with different input sizes, especially the minimum and maximum constraints. This will help you validate that your solution works for all edge cases."

    {
      "content": "Finally, put together all the pieces: a loop that processes the array, checks its length, concatenates the first and last elements, updates the concatenation value, and removes those elements until the array is empty."
