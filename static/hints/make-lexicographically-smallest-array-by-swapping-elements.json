      "content": "Consider the implications of the limit on the array. For example, if the limit is very small, you may not be able to swap many elements, which could affect your ability to sort the array."

      "content": "Think about how you can group elements based on their values and the limit. Elements that can be swapped with each other can form a connected component. Look for ways to identify these groups."
