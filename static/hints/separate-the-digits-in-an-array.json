      "content": "Remember that after converting the integer to a string, each character represents a digit. You will need to convert these characters back to integers before adding them to your final result array."

    {
      "content": "When you separate the digits from each integer, ensure that you maintain the order of digits as they appear in the original integer. This means you should append each digit to your result list in the order you extract them."

    {
      "content": "To summarize, your approach should involve iterating over `nums`, converting each integer to its string representation, extracting the digits, converting them back to integers, and appending them to a result list. Start coding this step-by-step!"
