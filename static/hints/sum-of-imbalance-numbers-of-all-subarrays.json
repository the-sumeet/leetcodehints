      "content": "When you extract a subarray, you will need to sort it to calculate the imbalance number. Sorting can be done using built-in functions, but consider the time complexity."

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently count the imbalance numbers after sorting. You can iterate through the sorted subarray and count the pairs that have a difference greater than 1."

      "content": "Consider the constraints provided: 1 <= nums.length <= 1000. This means your solution should ideally be better than O(n^3) to handle the upper limits efficiently."
