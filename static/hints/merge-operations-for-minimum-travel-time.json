      "content": "Remember that merging operations can only occur between adjacent signs. This means you can only merge signs at indices `i` and `i + 1` where `1 <= i < n - 1`."

      "content": "When merging two signs, the time for the new sign becomes the sum of the two original times. Think about how this changes the travel time for the segments before and after the merge."

      "content": "When merging signs, ensure that you update both the `position` and `time` arrays correctly. After a merge, the new `time` should be the sum of the two merged times, and the `position` array should reflect the remaining signs."
