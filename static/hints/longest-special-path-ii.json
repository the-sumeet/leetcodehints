      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input. You have a tree represented by edges and a corresponding values array. Each edge connects two nodes and has a certain length. Make sure you can visualize or represent this tree structure."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that a tree is a connected acyclic graph. This means there is exactly one path between any two nodes. This property will be useful when traversing the tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will traverse the tree. Depth-first search (DFS) is a common approach for tree traversal. Think about how you can keep track of the current path and its properties as you explore."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you traverse, you'll need to maintain a record of the values encountered on the current path. Use a data structure like a set to track unique values and a counter for any value that may appear twice."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the condition for a special path: all values must be distinct, except for at most one value that can appear twice. Think about how you can efficiently check this condition during your traversal."
    },
    {
      "content": "While traversing, also keep track of the current path length. You will need to compare this length against the longest special path found so far."

      "content": "When you find a longer special path, update your maximum length and reset your count of nodes in that path. If you find another path with the same length, consider how you will update the minimum number of nodes."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all nodes have the same value or when there are only two nodes. How will your logic handle these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle backtracking in your DFS. When you return from a node, you need to remove it from your current path and update your set or counter accordingly."
