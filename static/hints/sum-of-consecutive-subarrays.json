      "content": "Start by understanding what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], the subarrays include [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can generate all possible subarrays from the given array. You might want to use two nested loops: the outer loop to fix the starting index and the inner loop to fix the ending index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you generate each subarray, consider how you will calculate the sum of its elements. You can initialize a sum variable to zero and add each element of the subarray to it."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases. For example, what if the input array is empty? Make sure your solution can handle this scenario gracefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the performance of your solution. Generating all subarrays and calculating their sums can lead to a time complexity of O(n^3). Think about ways to optimize this, perhaps by using prefix sums."

    {
      "content": "When using prefix sums, you can store the cumulative sum of elements up to each index. This allows you to calculate the sum of any subarray in constant time."

    {
      "content": "Make sure you understand how to calculate the sum of a subarray using prefix sums. If `prefix[i]` is the sum of elements from index 0 to i, then the sum from index j to k can be calculated as `prefix[k] - prefix[j-1]`."

    {
      "content": "Consider the return format of your solution. Are you required to return just the sums, or do you need to return the subarrays themselves? Clarifying this will help shape your implementation."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you will handle duplicate subarrays. If the problem specifies unique sums, you might need to use a data structure like a set to keep track of sums you've already encountered."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your solution is tested against various test cases, including edge cases like arrays with negative numbers, large values, or very small arrays. A robust solution should handle all these scenarios effectively."
