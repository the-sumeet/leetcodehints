      "content": "Consider the lengths of the two strings, `s` and `t`. If `t` is longer than `s`, you will definitely need to append characters to `s`. Think about how you can align the characters of `t` with those in `s`."

      "content": "You will want to iterate through both strings to see how many characters from `t` can be matched with `s`. Use two pointers: one for `s` and one for `t`. This will help you track how many characters from `t` can be found in `s`."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate, whenever a character in `s` matches the current character in `t`, move the pointer for `t` forward. This way, you can count how many characters from `t` are matched in `s`."
