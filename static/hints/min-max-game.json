      "content": "Remember that you need to create a new array `newNums` that will hold the results of applying the min-max operations. The length of `newNums` will be half of the length of `nums`."

      "content": "When you're iterating through `nums`, pay attention to the indices. For every even index `i`, you will take the minimum of the two corresponding elements, and for every odd index, you will take the maximum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to correctly access elements in pairs. For an index `i` in `newNums`, the corresponding elements in `nums` are `nums[2 * i]` and `nums[2 * i + 1]`. This is crucial for the min-max operations."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will update `nums` with `newNums`. After each pass, `nums` should be replaced entirely with `newNums`, and the process should repeat until only one element remains."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that the values in `nums` can be large (up to 10^9), but the operations you perform (min and max) will not change the overall time complexity of your solution."

      "content": "As you implement the algorithm, consider using a loop to repeatedly apply the min-max transformation until you reach a single element. This will help you avoid deep recursion."
