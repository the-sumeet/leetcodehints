      "content": "Notice that if you replace an element in `arr1`, it must still maintain the strictly increasing property with respect to its neighbors. For instance, if you replace '5', the new value must be less than '6' and greater than '1'."

      "content": "When iterating through `arr1`, for each element, you should check both the current value and possible replacements from `arr2`. This will help you decide the best course of action."
