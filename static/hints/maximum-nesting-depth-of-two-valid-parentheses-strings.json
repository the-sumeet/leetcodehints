      "content": "Consider how you can split the string into two valid subsequences A and B. Think about how to maintain the balance of parentheses in both subsequences while ensuring they are still valid."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the string, keep track of the current depth of nesting. You can use a counter that increments with '(' and decrements with ')'. This will help you visualize how deep you are in the nesting at any point."

    {
      "content": "When splitting the string, aim to keep the depths of A and B as balanced as possible. This means you might want to alternate the assignment of parentheses to A and B based on the current depth."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to encode the result in the required format. You need to return an array where each index corresponds to the characters in the original string, with '0' for A and '1' for B."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember that the output does not need to be unique. There may be multiple valid ways to split the string, so focus on achieving a minimum maximum depth rather than a specific configuration."

    {
      "content": "You can use a stack-like approach to help manage the depth of the parentheses. Each time you encounter a '(', decide whether to push it to A or B based on the current depth of both subsequences."

    {
      "content": "While iterating through the string, consider maintaining two depth countersâ€”one for A and one for B. This will allow you to easily decide where to place the next parenthesis based on which subsequence currently has a lower depth."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution correctly handles the final output format. After determining which subsequence each character belongs to, construct the result array and return it."
