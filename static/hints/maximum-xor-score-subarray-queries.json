    {
      "content": "Start by understanding what the XOR operation does. XORing two numbers results in a number that has bits set to 1 where the corresponding bits of the operands differ. This property can help you think about how to maximize the XOR score."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to compute the XOR score for a subarray. The XOR score is obtained by repeatedly applying the XOR operation on adjacent elements until only one element remains. Try to derive a formula or a pattern from smaller examples."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the maximum XOR score can be found from various subarrays. You need to explore all possible subarrays within the specified range for each query. Think about how you can efficiently generate these subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating through subarrays, keep track of the maximum XOR score you find. You might want to use a nested loop to explore all subarrays starting from each index in the range specified by the query."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. The maximum length of the input array is 2000, and you can have up to 100,000 queries. This suggests that a naive O(n^3) solution will be too slow, so consider optimizing your approach."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can reduce the number of calculations. Instead of recalculating the XOR for every subarray from scratch, consider using a cumulative XOR array to help you compute the XOR for any subarray in constant time."
    },
    {
      "content": "A cumulative XOR array can be built where each element at index i contains the XOR of all elements from the start of the array up to index i. This will allow you to compute the XOR of any subarray nums[l..r] as: cumulativeXOR[r] XOR cumulativeXOR[l-1]."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing each query, make sure to handle the indices correctly. The queries are given in the form [l, r], so you need to ensure that your subarray generation respects these bounds."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when l equals r. In this scenario, the maximum XOR score will simply be nums[l] since it's the only element in the subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to store the results for each query in an output array. This array should be returned after processing all queries."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the XOR operation in terms of uniqueness. Two different subarrays can yield the same XOR score. Ensure that your method correctly identifies the maximum score without being affected by ties."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to optimize your solution further by using data structures that can help maintain the maximum value efficiently. Think about how you can leverage a max-heap or segment tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your implementation, test it with various edge cases, including arrays with all identical elements, arrays with maximum and minimum values, and queries that cover the entire range of the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your code is well-structured and includes comments explaining the logic behind your approach. This will help you during the interview to explain your thought process."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize, your approach should involve creating a cumulative XOR array, efficiently processing each query to find the maximum XOR score from subarrays, and handling edge cases appropriately. Start implementing this step by step."
