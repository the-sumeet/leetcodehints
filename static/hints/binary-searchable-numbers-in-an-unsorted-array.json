      "content": "Consider how you would implement a binary search algorithm. Remember that binary search works on sorted arrays, so sorting the input array is crucial before you can apply binary search."

      "content": "When sorting the array, remember to handle duplicates carefully. If there are multiple instances of a number, decide how you want to treat them in terms of binary search."

    {
      "content": "Next, think about how to identify the binary searchable numbers. You will need to iterate through the original array and check if each number can be found in the sorted version of the array."

      "content": "As you iterate through the original array, you can use a helper function for binary search. This function should return true if the number exists in the sorted array and false otherwise."

      "content": "Remember to consider the time complexity of your solution. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), and searching for each element takes O(log n). This could lead to a total time complexity of O(n log n) if you check each element."

      "content": "When implementing the binary search, ensure that you correctly handle the mid-point calculation and the conditions for moving the left and right pointers. This is crucial for the search to work correctly."
