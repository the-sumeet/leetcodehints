      "content": "Consider how water spreads over time. It will be helpful to visualize or simulate how the water expands from its starting points. This will be important for determining safe paths."

      "content": "As you simulate the water spread, use a queue to manage the cells that water will reach next. Each time you add a cell to the queue, you should also update the time it takes for water to reach that cell."

    {
      "content": "Consider the scenario where there are multiple paths to the destination. You will need to find the minimum time it takes to reach D, so keep track of the earliest time you can arrive."
