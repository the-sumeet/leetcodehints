      "content": "Since you can have at most `k` stops, the total number of edges (or flights) you can take is `k + 1`. This means from the source city, you can reach the destination city in `k + 1` flights at most."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases where there are no flights or if the source and destination are the same. If `src` is equal to `dst`, the cost should be `0` if no stops are needed."
