      "content": "Consider how the order of concatenation affects the final string length. You can join strings in two ways: str[i-1] + words[i] or words[i] + str[i-1]. Think about which option might be better in different scenarios."

      "content": "To minimize the length of the final string, you should keep track of the lengths of the strings as you perform join operations. Make sure to account for the potential character deletion when the last and first characters match."

      "content": "When you join two strings, the effective length can be calculated as: length(x) + length(y) - overlap, where overlap is 1 if the last character of x equals the first character of y, otherwise it is 0."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the words, maintain two possible lengths at each step: one for joining str[i-1] + words[i] and another for words[i] + str[i-1]. This will help you track the minimum length effectively."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where a word is entirely made of the same character, such as 'aaa'. Think about how this might affect the join operations and the resulting string length."

      "content": "As you compute the lengths, keep track of the minimum length after each join operation. This will allow you to ensure that you are always working towards the optimal solution."
