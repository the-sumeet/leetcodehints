    {
      "content": "Consider the input array. What happens if the array is empty or has fewer than three elements? How would you handle these edge cases in your solution?"

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find triplets. A brute force approach would involve three nested loops, which could be inefficient for larger arrays. Can you think of a way to reduce the time complexity?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Sorting the array can help simplify the problem. Once sorted, you can use a two-pointer technique to find pairs that, when added to a third element, yield a sum less than the target."

    {
      "content": "After sorting, iterate through the array with a fixed index for the first element of the triplet. For each fixed element, use two pointers to find pairs of elements that sum with the fixed element to be less than the target."

      "content": "When using the two-pointer technique, remember to adjust the pointers based on the sum of the triplet. If the sum is less than the target, all pairs between the left pointer and the right pointer will also be valid."

      "content": "Make sure to handle duplicates in the input array. If the same number appears multiple times, it could lead to counting the same triplet more than once. How will you ensure uniqueness?"

    {
      "content": "Think about the return value. You need to return the count of valid triplets. How will you accumulate this count as you iterate through the array?"
