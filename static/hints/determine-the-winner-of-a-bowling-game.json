      "content": "Remember that if a player hits 10 pins in either the (i-1)th or (i-2)th turn, their score for the current turn is doubled. Make sure to check these conditions carefully as you calculate scores."

      "content": "When implementing the scoring logic, you might find it helpful to create a temporary variable to hold the score for the current turn before adding it to the total score. This can make your code clearer."
