This means you need to parse the string carefully to distinguish between single digits and two-digit numbers followed by '#'."

      "content": "When you encounter a '#', remember that it indicates that the two preceding digits form a character from 'j' to 'z'. Make sure to handle the index correctly to avoid going out of bounds when checking for the '#' character."
