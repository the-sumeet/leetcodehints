      "content": "Start by understanding the concept of the least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of two numbers is the smallest number that is a multiple of both. For example, lcm(2, 3) = 6 and lcm(4, 5) = 20."

      "content": "Remember that two nodes are connected if their LCM is less than or equal to the given threshold. This means you need to check pairs of nodes to see if they are connected."

      "content": "You will need to iterate through each pair of nodes in the nums array. For each pair (i, j), calculate the LCM and check if it's less than or equal to the threshold."

    {
      "content": "When calculating the LCM, remember the relationship: lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b). This can help you avoid overflow issues when dealing with large integers."

      "content": "Think about edge cases. For example, if the threshold is very small, it might lead to many isolated nodes. Conversely, a very large threshold could connect almost all nodes."

      "content": "You can also consider the properties of LCM and how they relate to the factors of numbers. This can help in reducing the number of checks you need to perform."
