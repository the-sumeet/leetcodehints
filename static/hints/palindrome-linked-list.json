    "The linked list is singly linked, meaning you can only traverse it in one direction.",
    "You need to return a boolean value: true if the list is a palindrome, false otherwise.",
    "The constraints specify that the number of nodes is between 1 and 100,000, and node values are between 0 and 9."
