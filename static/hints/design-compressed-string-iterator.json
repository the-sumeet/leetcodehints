      "content": "Think about how you will store the characters and their counts. You might want to use a list or a similar structure to keep track of the current character and how many times it should be returned."

      "content": "Consider how you will iterate over the compressed string. You will need to parse the string to extract each character and its corresponding count. A simple loop can help you achieve this."

      "content": "When implementing the `next()` method, remember that it should return the next character in the sequence according to the counts. You may need to maintain a pointer to track your current position in the iteration."

      "content": "The `hasNext()` method should check if there are more characters to return. This means you need to determine if your current position has reached the end of the sequence based on the counts you've parsed."
