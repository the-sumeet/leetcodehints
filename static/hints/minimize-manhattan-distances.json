      "content": "Consider how the maximum distance between points changes when you remove a point. You need to evaluate the distances between all remaining pairs after each point is removed."

      "content": "You can simplify the problem by realizing that the maximum Manhattan distance will be determined by the extreme points in the set. Identify the points with the maximum and minimum x and y coordinates."

      "content": "When you remove a point, check if it is one of the extreme points (max x, min x, max y, min y). If it is, you will need to find the next extreme point to determine the new maximum distance."

      "content": "Consider the four extreme values: max_x, min_x, max_y, and min_y. When a point is removed, the maximum distance will likely involve one of these extreme points."

      "content": "As you iterate through each point to remove, calculate the maximum distance using the remaining extreme points. This will help you find the new maximum distance efficiently."
