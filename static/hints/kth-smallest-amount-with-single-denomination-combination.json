      "content": "Consider how each coin can generate an infinite series of amounts. For example, a coin of denomination 3 can generate 3, 6, 9, 12, etc. Think about how you can represent these amounts."

      "content": "Remember that you cannot combine coins of different denominations. This means that for each coin, you will only be working with its multiples."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can think of the amounts generated by each coin as separate sequences. For instance, if you have coins [3, 6, 9], you have three sequences: multiples of 3, multiples of 6, and multiples of 9."

      "content": "To find the k-th smallest amount, consider merging these sequences. This is similar to merging k sorted lists. What data structure could help you efficiently find the next smallest amount?"

      "content": "A min-heap (or priority queue) can be useful here. You can push the first multiple of each coin into the heap and then repeatedly extract the smallest element."

      "content": "When you extract the smallest amount from the heap, remember to push the next multiple of the corresponding coin back into the heap. This way, you maintain a list of potential candidates for the next smallest amount."

      "content": "Think about the constraints on the coin denominations. With a maximum of 15 coins and each coin being at most 25, how does this affect the number of unique amounts you can generate?"

      "content": "What happens if two coins can generate the same amount? Ensure your approach accounts for this to avoid counting duplicates."
