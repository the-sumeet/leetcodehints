      "content": "To start, remember that the Hamming distance is a measure of how many bits differ between two integers. Think about how you can compare the bits of both integers."

    {
      "content": "You can use the XOR operation (`^`) to find the bits that differ between two integers. When you XOR two bits, the result is `1` if they are different and `0` if they are the same."
    },
    {
      "content": "After performing the XOR operation on `x` and `y`, you will get a new integer. The bits set to `1` in this result represent the positions where `x` and `y` differ."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, you need to count the number of `1`s in the result of the XOR operation. This count will give you the Hamming distance."
    },
    {
      "content": "To count the number of `1`s in an integer, you can use a loop to repeatedly check the least significant bit (LSB) and right shift the integer until it becomes `0`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Alternatively, you can use a built-in function if your programming language supports it. For example, Python has `bin(n).count('1')` to count the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `n`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when both integers are `0`. What should the Hamming distance be in this case? Think about how your approach handles this scenario."

      "content": "Remember that the Hamming distance is always a non-negative integer. Ensure your implementation correctly reflects this in all cases."
