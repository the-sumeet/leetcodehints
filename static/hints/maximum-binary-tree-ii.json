      "content": "When you receive the new value `val`, think about how it will fit into the existing tree. Since `val` is guaranteed to be unique, it will either become the new root or be placed in one of the subtrees."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to extract the original array `a` from the given tree. You can perform a traversal to gather the values in an array format, which will help you understand the placement of `val`."

    {
      "content": "After constructing the array `a`, create the new array `b` by appending `val` to `a`. This new array will then be used to construct the new maximum binary tree."

    {
      "content": "When constructing the new tree, ensure that you maintain the same left and right subtree structures as defined by the original tree. This means carefully managing how you split the array for the left and right children."

      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, such as when `val` is less than all existing values or greater than all. These scenarios will affect how you construct the tree."

    {
      "content": "As you implement the `Construct` function, ensure that it handles the base case correctly. If the input array is empty, the function should return null."
