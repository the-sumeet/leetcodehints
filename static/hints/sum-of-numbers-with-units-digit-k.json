      "content": "Consider the relationship between `num` and `k`. The sum of the integers must equal `num`, and since each integer contributes a units digit of `k`, think about how this affects the total sum."

      "content": "Notice that if `num` is less than `k`, it is impossible to form such a set, except when `num` is 0. For instance, if `num = 1` and `k = 2`, you cannot form a valid set."

      "content": "If `num` is 0, the only valid set is the empty set, which has a size of 0. This is a special case that you should handle explicitly."

    {
      "content": "To determine if a valid set exists, check if `num - k` is non-negative and divisible by 10. This will help ensure that the remaining sum can be achieved with integers ending in `k`."

      "content": "Think about the modular arithmetic involved. Specifically, check if `(num - k) % 10 == 0`. This condition will help you confirm whether you can form the required sum."
