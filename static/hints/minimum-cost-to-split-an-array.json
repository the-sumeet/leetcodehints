      "content": "Start by understanding the concept of a subarray. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], the subarrays include [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2], [2, 3], and [3]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on how to calculate the importance value of a subarray. The importance value is determined by adding a constant k to the length of the trimmed version of the subarray."

    {
      "content": "The trimmed version of a subarray is obtained by removing all elements that appear only once. For instance, if your subarray is [1, 2, 2, 3], the trimmed version would be [2, 2]."

      "content": "To find the minimum cost of splitting the array, consider how different splits affect the total cost. Each split will create two or more subarrays, each with its own importance value."

    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the parameter k. A larger k will increase the importance value of each subarray, potentially affecting how you choose to split the array."

      "content": "You will need to iterate through possible split points in the array. For each split point, calculate the importance value for the resulting subarrays."

      "content": "Keep track of the frequency of elements as you create subarrays. This will help you efficiently compute the trimmed length for each subarray."

      "content": "Consider using a dynamic programming approach. You can define a DP array where dp[i] represents the minimum cost to split the array up to index i."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating dp[i], you will need to look back at previous indices to determine where to split. For each possible split point j, compute the cost of the subarray from j to i."

      "content": "To efficiently compute the trimmed length, maintain a frequency map of elements in the current subarray. Update this map as you extend the subarray."

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when all elements in the array are unique or when all elements are the same. These cases will affect the trimmed length significantly."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to initialize your DP array correctly. dp[0] should represent the cost of the first element as a subarray, which will simply be k + 0."

      "content": "Consider the time complexity of your approach. A naive solution might be too slow, so think about how to optimize the frequency counting and importance calculation."
