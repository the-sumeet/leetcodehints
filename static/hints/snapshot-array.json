      "content": "Consider how to implement the `set(index, val)` method. You need to store the value at the specified index. Remember, this method should update the current value of the array."

      "content": "When implementing `get(index, snap_id)`, you need to retrieve the value from the array as it was at the time of the specified snapshot. This means you might need to store historical values."

      "content": "Consider using a list of lists (or a similar data structure) to store the values for each index over time. For example, `history[index]` could hold all values set at that index across different snapshots."

      "content": "When you take a snapshot, you should not only store the current values but also ensure that future updates do not affect past snapshots. This might involve creating a new entry in your history structure."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize the data structure, you might want to maintain an array of lists where each list corresponds to an index in the `SnapshotArray`. Each list will hold the values set at that index for each snapshot."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, your `get(index, snap_id)` function should efficiently retrieve the correct value. You may need to implement a binary search or a similar technique to find the right value in the history list for the given `snap_id`."
