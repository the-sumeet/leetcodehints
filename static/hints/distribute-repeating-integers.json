    {
      "content": "Notice that the maximum number of unique integers in `nums` is 50. This means you can leverage this limited variety when considering how to satisfy each customer's order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider counting the occurrences of each unique integer in `nums`. This will help you determine how many of each integer you have available for distribution."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the orders in `quantity`. Each order specifies a quantity of identical integers. You might want to sort this array to prioritize larger orders first."

    {
      "content": "When distributing integers, remember that you can only give a customer integers of one type. This means you need to ensure that for each order, you have enough of a single integer type available."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to visualize the distribution as a backtracking problem. For each customer, you can attempt to assign them integers from `nums` and backtrack if you can't satisfy their order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases: What happens if `quantity` contains an order larger than the total count of any single integer in `nums`? This would immediately make it impossible to satisfy that customer."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a frequency map for `nums` to keep track of how many of each integer you have. This will allow you to check quickly if you can fulfill an order."

    {
      "content": "As you attempt to assign integers to customers, keep in mind that once you assign an integer to a customer, you should reduce the count of that integer in your frequency map."

    {
      "content": "You may want to implement a recursive function that tries to assign integers to each customer in order. If you reach a point where you can't satisfy a customer's order, return false."

      "content": "Consider what happens if you have leftover integers in `nums` after satisfying all customer orders. This doesn't affect the solution as long as all orders are fulfilled."

    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a pruning strategy in your backtracking. If at any point you can't satisfy the remaining orders with the available integers, you should stop exploring that path."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep in mind the time complexity of your solution. Since `m` (the number of customers) can be up to 10 and the maximum unique integers is 50, your solution should be efficient enough to handle these limits."
