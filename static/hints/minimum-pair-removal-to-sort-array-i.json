      "content": "When selecting a pair to replace, you should focus on finding the pair with the minimum sum. This means you need to calculate the sum of each adjacent pair and keep track of the minimum sum found."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep in mind that you will need to loop through the array multiple times: once to find the minimum pair, and potentially multiple times to continue replacing pairs until sorted."
