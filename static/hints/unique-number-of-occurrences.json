      "content": "Consider using a data structure that allows you to store counts of each number. A dictionary or a hash map can be useful for this purpose, where the key is the number and the value is its count."

      "content": "As you count the occurrences of each number, think about how you will store these counts. You might want to create a second structure to keep track of how many times each count occurs."

      "content": "After counting the occurrences, you can convert your counts into a list or set. If the length of this list or set is the same as the number of unique numbers, then the occurrences are unique."

      "content": "When checking for uniqueness, consider how you will compare the counts. If you use a set, you can simply compare the size of the set to the number of unique counts."
