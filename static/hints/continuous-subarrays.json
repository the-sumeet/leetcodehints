      "content": "Pay attention to the condition for continuity: the absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray must be at most 2. This means that for any two elements nums[i1] and nums[i2] in the subarray, |nums[i1] - nums[i2]| <= 2."

      "content": "Consider how you can efficiently find all continuous subarrays. A brute force approach would involve checking all possible subarrays, but this can be inefficient. Think about using a sliding window or two-pointer technique to maintain a valid range."

    {
      "content": "When using a sliding window, you can maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, that represent the current subarray. As you expand the `end` pointer to include new elements, check if the condition for continuity is still satisfied."

    {
      "content": "If the condition is violated (i.e., |nums[end] - nums[i]| > 2 for any i in the window), you will need to move the `start` pointer to shrink the window until the condition is satisfied again."
