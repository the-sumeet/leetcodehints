      "content": "Think about how to process the `queries`. Each query gives you a specific time, and you need to check the interval from `queries[i] - x` to `queries[i]`. Make sure you understand how to handle inclusive intervals."

      "content": "You will need to check for each query how many servers did not receive any requests in the specified time interval. This means you should first determine which servers did receive requests in that interval."

      "content": "Remember that the server IDs are 1-indexed but your logs and queries are 0-indexed. Be cautious when accessing elements in arrays to avoid off-by-one errors."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there are no logs at all or when all servers receive requests. How will your solution handle these scenarios?"
