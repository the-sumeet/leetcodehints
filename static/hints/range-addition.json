      "content": "Start by understanding the input format. You have an integer `n` which represents the size of an array, and a list of operations where each operation is defined by three integers: `start`, `end`, and `increment`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would apply each operation to an array of size `n`. Each operation specifies a range from `start` to `end`, and you need to add `increment` to each element in that range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to initialize your array. You will need an array of size `n` initialized to zero, as you will be modifying its values based on the operations provided."
    },
    {
      "content": "Instead of applying each operation directly to the array, consider a more efficient approach. You might want to use a technique that allows you to mark the start and end of increments, which can help reduce time complexity."
    },
    {
      "content": "Explore the concept of a difference array. When you want to increment a range, you can increment the start index and decrement the position right after the end index. This will allow you to compute the final values in a single pass."
    },
    {
      "content": "After marking the increments in the difference array, remember to compute the prefix sum to get the actual values in the original array. This is crucial for obtaining the final result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `n` is 0. What should your function return in that case? Make sure your implementation gracefully handles such scenarios."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints on the values of `start`, `end`, and `increment`. Ensure that your implementation can handle cases where these values might lead to out-of-bounds errors or unexpected behavior."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the final output should be the modified array after all operations have been applied. Make sure your function returns the correct format, which is typically a list of integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "You are very close! After applying all operations and computing the prefix sum, your final step is to return the modified array. Ensure that you have accounted for all operations correctly before returning."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The input consists of an integer n and a list of operations, each defined by three integers: start, end, and increment.",
    "The operations are 0-indexed, meaning the first element of the array is at index 0.",
    "The final output should be an array of size n, reflecting the cumulative effects of all operations.",
    "Edge cases include handling when n = 0, which should return an empty array."
