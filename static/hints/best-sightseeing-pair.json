    {
      "content": "Consider how the indices `i` and `j` relate to each other. Since `i` must be less than `j`, think about how you can iterate through the array while maintaining this condition."

      "content": "As you calculate the score for pairs, note that the formula can be rearranged to focus on maximizing `values[i] + i` and `values[j] - j`. This might help simplify your calculations."
