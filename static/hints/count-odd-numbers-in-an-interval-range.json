      "content": "Consider the properties of odd and even numbers. If 'low' is odd, then it is included in your count. If 'low' is even, the next number (low + 1) will be the first odd number in the range."

      "content": "Think about how to determine the last odd number in the range. If 'high' is odd, include it; if it is even, the number just before it (high - 1) will be the last odd number."

      "content": "Calculate the total count of odd numbers using the formula for the number of terms in an arithmetic sequence. The odd numbers form a sequence where the first term is the first odd number in the range and the last term is the last odd number."

    {
      "content": "You can simplify the counting process by calculating the number of odd numbers up to 'high' and subtracting the number of odd numbers up to 'low - 1'. This way, you can avoid counting directly within the range."

    {
      "content": "To count odd numbers up to a given number 'n', you can use the formula: n // 2 + n % 2. This gives you the count of odd numbers from 1 to 'n'."
