      "content": "To find the longest sequential prefix, you will need to iterate through the array and check if each element continues the sequential pattern. Keep track of the length of the longest sequential prefix you find."

      "content": "As you iterate through the array, maintain a variable to store the sum of the elements in the current sequential prefix. Whenever you find a break in the sequence, compare the current sum with the maximum sum found so far."
