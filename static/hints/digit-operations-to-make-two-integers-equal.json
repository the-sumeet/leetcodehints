      "content": "Consider the operations allowed: you can only increase digits that are not 9 and decrease digits that are not 0. Think about how these constraints might affect your ability to transform n into m."

      "content": "Remember that n must never be a prime number during the transformation. Itâ€™s essential to check if n or any intermediate value becomes prime after an operation."

      "content": "To check if a number is prime, you can use a simple function that tests divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. This will be useful to ensure n remains non-prime."
