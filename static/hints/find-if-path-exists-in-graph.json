      "content": "Consider using an adjacency list to represent the graph. This is a common and efficient way to store graph data. For example, if you have edges like [[0,1],[1,2]], your adjacency list might look like: {0: [1], 1: [0, 2], 2: [1]}."

      "content": "Think about how to traverse the graph. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are both suitable methods for exploring paths in a graph. Which one do you think would be more appropriate for this problem?"

    {
      "content": "If you choose DFS, remember to keep track of visited nodes to avoid cycles and infinite loops. You can use a set or an array to mark nodes as visited."

      "content": "As you traverse the graph, if you explore all possible paths and do not find the destination, you should return false. Make sure to handle the case where there are no edges in the graph."

      "content": "Finally, make sure your function returns the correct boolean value based on whether a path exists. You can structure your return statements to reflect this clearly."
