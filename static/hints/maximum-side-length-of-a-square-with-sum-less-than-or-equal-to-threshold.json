      "content": "Think about how you can optimize the sum calculation. Instead of recalculating the sum for every square from scratch, consider using a prefix sum array to store cumulative sums."

      "content": "When checking for the maximum side length, you should iterate through potential side lengths starting from the largest possible down to 1. This way, you can return the first valid side length you find."
