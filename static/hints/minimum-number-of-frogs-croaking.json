    {
      "content": "Consider using a counter for each character in 'croak'. You can maintain a count for 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' as you iterate through the input string. This will help you track how many frogs are currently croaking."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the counts of each character. For example, when you encounter 'r', you should ensure there's at least one 'c' before it. If not, the string is invalid."

      "content": "Don't forget to check if the counts of 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', and 'k' are balanced at the end of your iteration. If they aren't, return -1 because it means some croaks have not been completed."

      "content": "At the end of your iteration, ensure that all counts are zero. If any count is greater than zero, it indicates that some frogs are still croaking, which is also invalid."
