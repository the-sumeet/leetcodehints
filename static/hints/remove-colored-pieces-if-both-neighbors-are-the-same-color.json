      "content": "Start by understanding the rules of the game. Alice can only remove 'A' pieces if both neighbors are 'A', and Bob can only remove 'B' pieces if both neighbors are 'B'. This means that the positions of the pieces matter significantly."

    {
      "content": "Consider how the game progresses. Alice goes first, so you should think about the possible moves she can make initially. If there are no valid moves for Alice on her first turn, she loses immediately."

    {
      "content": "Analyze the string to identify clusters of 'A's and 'B's. For example, in the string 'AAABABB', the clusters are 'AAA', 'B', 'A', 'BB'. Recognizing these clusters can help you visualize potential moves."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. What happens if the string is very short, like 'A' or 'B'? Or if it consists only of one type of piece, like 'AAAA' or 'BBBB'? How does that affect the game?"

    {
      "content": "When Alice makes a move, it alters the string. After she removes an 'A', check if that creates new opportunities for either player. You may need to simulate the game to see how the pieces change."

    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of removing pieces. For example, if Alice removes an 'A' and it causes a 'B' to have both neighbors as 'B', Bob can then make a move. This could lead to a chain reaction."

    {
      "content": "Remember that Alice and Bob play optimally. This means they will always make moves that maximize their chances of winning. Think about how you can simulate this optimal play."

      "content": "You might want to keep track of the current state of the game after each move. This could be done using a list or a modified string to reflect the remaining pieces."

    {
      "content": "Consider implementing a recursive function or a loop that simulates the game turn by turn. After each player's move, check if they can make another move or if they have lost."

      "content": "Finally, think about how to determine the winner. You can return true if Alice wins and false if Bob wins after all possible moves have been made. Ensure your function handles all edge cases correctly."
