      "content": "Start by understanding the relationship between the two strings, `order` and `s`. The string `order` defines a custom sorting for the characters in `s`. Your goal is to rearrange the characters in `s` according to the order specified in `order`."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can keep track of the characters in `s` that appear in `order`. You might want to use a frequency count of characters in `s` to help with the rearrangement."

      "content": "When you iterate through the characters in `order`, you can build the result string by appending the characters from `s` that match the current character in `order`, based on their frequency."

      "content": "As you build the result string, ensure that you are efficiently managing the counts of characters. You might want to use a list to gather the characters from `s` that match the order and then join them into a final string."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to implement the final step where you concatenate the characters from `order` and the remaining characters from `s`. You might want to use a loop to go through the frequency map."
