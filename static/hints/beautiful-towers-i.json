      "content": "Consider the peak of the mountain. The peak can be any tower, and the heights to the left and right of the peak must be less than or equal to the peak height. How can you determine the maximum height for each tower based on its neighbors?"

      "content": "You might want to create two arrays: one for the left heights and one for the right heights. The left array can store the maximum possible height at each tower when considering the towers to its left."

      "content": "For the left heights array, iterate from left to right. For each tower, set its height to be the minimum of its original height and the height of the previous tower plus one. This ensures the non-decreasing property."
