    {
      "content": "Once you have the minimum number, you need to calculate the sum of its digits. Think about how you can extract each digit from a number. For example, you can convert the number to a string and then iterate through each character."

    {
      "content": "Consider the edge case where the input list might contain negative numbers. How will you handle that? Remember, the problem specifies finding the minimum number, so ensure your comparison logic accounts for all integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the sum of the digits, think about how to handle leading zeros. For instance, the number '001' should be treated as '1'. Ensure your solution correctly sums the digits without any extra leading zeros."

      "content": "You might want to create a helper function to calculate the sum of digits. This function could take an integer as input and return the sum of its digits. Consider using integer division and modulus to extract digits."

    {
      "content": "When you find the minimum number, you can use a single loop to both find the minimum and calculate the sum of its digits. This will save you from having to loop through the list multiple times."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases like a list with one number, all numbers being the same, or a list with negative numbers. This will help ensure your solution is robust."
