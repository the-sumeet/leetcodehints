    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent this relationship. A common approach is to use an adjacency list or a matrix to store the prerequisites. For example, if you have prerequisites = [[1, 0]], you can represent this as an edge from 1 to 0."

      "content": "Think about how you can determine if one course is a prerequisite of another. You could perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) starting from the course in question to see if you can reach the other course."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem states that prerequisites can be indirect. This means if course A is a prerequisite of course B, and course B is a prerequisite of course C, then course A is also a prerequisite of course C."

      "content": "Consider the constraints given in the problem. You have a maximum of 100 courses and up to 10^4 queries. This means your solution should be efficient enough to handle multiple queries without recalculating the prerequisite relationships each time."

    {
      "content": "You might want to preprocess the prerequisite relationships before answering the queries. One way to do this is to use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute transitive closure, which will help you determine if one course is a prerequisite of another in O(numCourses^3) time."

      "content": "When processing the queries, ensure that you are correctly indexing the courses. The courses are labeled from 0 to numCourses - 1, so make sure your checks respect this indexing."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider edge cases such as when there are no prerequisites at all. In this case, any query asking if one course is a prerequisite of another should return false."
