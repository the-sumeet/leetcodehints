      "content": "You can use a two-pointer technique: one pointer to iterate through the array and another pointer to track the position of the last valid element. This can help you efficiently remove elements."

    {
      "content": "Your final implementation should look something like this: iterate through the array, check each element, and if it's not equal to `val`, place it at the current index and increment that index. Finally, return the index as the count of valid elements."
