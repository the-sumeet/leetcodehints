    "The graph is undirected, meaning that if there's an edge from u to v, there's also an edge from v to u.",
    "The distance limit in queries is inclusive; a path with a total length equal to the limit is valid.",
    "The input edges may contain duplicates; ensure your implementation accounts for this.",
    "The nodes are indexed from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of nodes in the graph.",
    "The return format for each query is a boolean indicating whether a valid path exists under the given distance limit."
