      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to remove adjacent duplicate letters from the string until no more can be removed. Think about how you can identify these adjacent duplicates efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a stack data structure. As you iterate through the string, you can push characters onto the stack. If the current character is the same as the character on top of the stack, you can pop the stack instead of pushing the current character."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the stack will help you maintain the order of characters. When you encounter a duplicate, popping from the stack will effectively remove both characters from consideration."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when the string is very short (like a single character) or when there are no duplicates at all. How should your approach handle these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to construct the final result from the stack. After processing all characters, you will need to convert the stack back into a string. This can typically be done by joining the characters in the stack."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including those with multiple layers of duplicates. For instance, in 'abccba', the duplicates are not adjacent initially, but they become so after some removals."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. Using a stack allows you to process each character once, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you're using a stack, remember to handle the case where the stack might be empty. You should check if the stack is empty before trying to access its top element."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep in mind the constraints: the string length can be up to 100,000 characters. Your solution should be efficient enough to handle this maximum input size."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, once you have processed the entire string, convert the stack to a string and return it. This will be your final result after all duplicate removals."
