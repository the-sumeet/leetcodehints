      "content": "Check if it's possible to create these subsets. If any number appears more than `k` times in `nums`, it's impossible to create the subsets without duplicates. Consider using a frequency count to validate this."

      "content": "Think about the concept of incompatibility. The incompatibility of a subset is defined by the difference between its maximum and minimum values. This means you need to focus on the range of numbers in each subset."
