      "content": "Notice that for each index `i`, you can only consider obstacles from index `0` to `i`. This means your solution needs to build upon previously calculated results."

      "content": "To efficiently find the longest valid course ending at each index, consider using a data structure that allows you to quickly find the position of the current obstacle in a growing list of valid obstacles."
