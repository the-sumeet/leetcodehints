      "content": "Remember that a palindromic substring of length 2 is simply two identical characters next to each other (like 'aa'). Plan how to avoid these while generating new strings."

    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when 's' is already at the maximum possible beautiful string for the given 'k'. For example, if 's' is 'abcd...' up to 'k', you should return an empty string."
