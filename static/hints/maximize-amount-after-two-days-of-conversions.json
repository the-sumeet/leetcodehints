    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the currency conversion pairs and their rates. You can use a dictionary or a map to store the conversion rates for both days. This will help you efficiently look up rates when performing conversions."

      "content": "On day 1, you can convert your initial currency to other currencies using the rates provided. Think about how you can maximize the amount of currency you have after all possible conversions on day 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "After performing conversions on day 1, remember that you can also convert back to the initial currency using the inverse of the rates. This means you should also consider the possibility of converting back to maximize your final amount."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, focus on day 2. Similar to day 1, you can convert any currency you have after day 1 into other currencies using the rates for day 2. Again, think about maximizing your amount at the end of day 2."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where you might not want to convert at all on a given day. This means you should always consider the option of keeping the current amount without performing any conversions."

      "content": "When implementing the conversion logic, consider using a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) approach to explore all possible conversion paths for both days. This will help you find the maximum amount efficiently."

    {
      "content": "Keep track of the maximum amount of currency you can have after each conversion step. You can use a variable to store this maximum and update it whenever you find a new conversion that yields a higher amount."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when there are no valid conversions for a currency on a given day. Ensure your implementation can handle such scenarios gracefully without errors."
