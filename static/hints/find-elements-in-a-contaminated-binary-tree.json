For example, if a node has a value of x, then its left child will have a value of 2 * x + 1 and the right child will have 2 * x + 2."

      "content": "Since the tree is contaminated, all nodes have a value of -1. You'll need to traverse the tree and recover the original values based on the rules provided. Consider using a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to explore the tree."

    {
      "content": "As you recover the values, think about how you can store these values for quick access later. A set or a hash map can be useful for storing the recovered values, allowing for O(1) average time complexity when checking if a target exists."

      "content": "When implementing the recovery process, ensure that you are correctly assigning values to both left and right children based on their parent's value. This will involve recursive calls or iterative traversal to ensure all nodes are processed."
