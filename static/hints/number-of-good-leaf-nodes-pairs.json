      "content": "Start by understanding what defines a 'leaf node' in a binary tree. A leaf node is a node that has no children. In this problem, you will need to identify all leaf nodes in the given tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can traverse the binary tree to find the leaf nodes. A Depth-First Search (DFS) approach is often effective for this kind of problem. Think about how you would implement DFS to collect leaf nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the leaf nodes, you need to calculate the distance between pairs of them. The distance between two leaf nodes is defined as the number of edges in the shortest path connecting them. Make sure you understand how to calculate this distance."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem requires you to count pairs of leaf nodes that are 'good'. A pair is good if the distance between them is less than or equal to the given distance. Think about how you can efficiently check all pairs of leaf nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a nested loop to check each pair of leaf nodes, but be cautious about performance. The number of leaf nodes can be large, so consider how you can optimize the pair checking process."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the tree has only one node or when all leaf nodes are at the maximum distance from each other. How would your solution handle these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "You could also think about using a helper function to calculate the distance between two specific leaf nodes. This function could leverage the tree structure to find the path length efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep track of the number of good pairs you find. You can use a counter that increments every time you find a valid pair of leaf nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "When counting pairs, ensure that you do not count the same pair twice. You can achieve this by only considering pairs where the first leaf node comes before the second in your list of leaf nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the result. The problem states to return the number of good leaf node pairs, so your function should ultimately return this count after processing all pairs."
