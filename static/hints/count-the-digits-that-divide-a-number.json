      "content": "Consider how you can convert the integer `num` into its individual digits. You might want to use a loop or string conversion to achieve this."

      "content": "Remember that the problem specifies that `num` will not contain the digit `0`. This simplifies your checks since you won't have to handle division by zero."

      "content": "As you extract each digit, keep a count of how many of them divide `num`. You can initialize a counter variable to zero and increment it whenever you find a digit that divides `num`."
