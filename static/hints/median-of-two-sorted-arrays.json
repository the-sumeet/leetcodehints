    },
    {
      "content": "Given two sorted arrays, think about how you might merge them to find the median. However, directly merging them would lead to a time complexity of O(m+n), which is not efficient enough for this problem."

      "content": "Consider the properties of sorted arrays. You can use binary search to help you find the median without merging the arrays. This is key to achieving the O(log(min(m, n))) time complexity."

      "content": "Focus on partitioning the two arrays. You want to find a point where the left side of the partition contains all elements less than or equal to the elements on the right side."

    {
      "content": "The key conditions for a valid partition are: nums1[i-1] <= nums2[j] and nums2[j-1] <= nums1[i]. Ensure you check edge cases where i or j could be 0 or the length of the array."

    {
      "content": "If the combined length of the arrays is odd, the median is the maximum of the left partitions. If it's even, the median is the average of the maximum of the left partitions and the minimum of the right partitions."

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases where one of the arrays is empty. In such cases, the median will simply be the median of the non-empty array."

    {
      "content": "You will need to adjust your binary search based on the conditions of the partitions. If nums1[i-1] > nums2[j], move your search to the left in nums1; otherwise, move to the right."
