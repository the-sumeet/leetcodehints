      "content": "Next, note that a k-palindromic integer must also be divisible by k. This means that any number you consider must meet both conditions: being a palindrome and divisible by k."

    {
      "content": "A palindrome has a specific structure: if it has an even length, all digits must appear an even number of times. If it has an odd length, only one digit can appear an odd number of times, while others must appear an even number of times."
