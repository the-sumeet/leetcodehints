      "content": "Think about how you can calculate the total number of coins needed for the first k rows. The total number of coins for k rows is the sum of the first k natural numbers, which can be expressed as k * (k + 1) / 2."

      "content": "Consider how you can use a loop to incrementally build the staircase. You can keep a counter for the number of rows and a variable to track the total coins used so far."

      "content": "You might also want to think about optimizing your approach. Instead of iterating through each row, can you find a mathematical way to calculate the maximum number of complete rows directly?"
