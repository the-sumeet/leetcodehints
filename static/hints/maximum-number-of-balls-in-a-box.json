      "content": "You need to iterate through each ball number from lowLimit to highLimit. For each number, calculate the sum of its digits and determine the corresponding box."

      "content": "Consider using a dictionary or an array to keep track of how many balls are placed in each box. The key will be the box number (sum of digits), and the value will be the count of balls in that box."

      "content": "Remember to initialize your data structure before you start counting the balls. You might want to use a default value of 0 for each box to handle cases where no balls are placed in certain boxes."

      "content": "As you calculate the sum of digits for each ball, think about how to efficiently compute this. You can convert the number to a string and sum the integer values of each character, or use arithmetic operations to extract digits."

      "content": "Once you have counted the balls in each box, your next step is to find the maximum value in your data structure. This will give you the maximum number of balls in any box."
