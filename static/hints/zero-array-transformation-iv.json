      "content": "Consider how each query modifies the `nums` array. For example, if `nums = [2, 0, 2]` and you apply the query `[0, 2, 1]`, you would subtract 1 from all elements in the range from index 0 to 2."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to keep track of the cumulative effect of the queries. You might want to simulate the application of each query one by one and check the state of `nums` after each query."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the goal is to turn `nums` into a Zero Array, meaning all elements must be zero. As you apply queries, check if any element in `nums` becomes negative, which would indicate that the queries cannot achieve a Zero Array."

      "content": "When applying a query, ensure that you only decrement the values in the specified range. You can use a simple for loop to iterate over the indices from `l` to `r` and decrement each corresponding value in `nums`."
