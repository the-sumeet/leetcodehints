      "content": "Start by understanding the knight's movement on a chessboard. The knight can move in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and one square perpendicular. This gives it eight possible moves from any position."

      "content": "Consider how to calculate the minimum number of moves required for the knight to reach each pawn. You can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore all possible knight moves from its starting position."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the knight can pass over other pawns without capturing them. Focus on the pawn that is selected for capture in each turn, as this will influence the game's strategy."

      "content": "When calculating the total number of moves, remember that each player will always choose the pawn that best serves their strategy. This means considering not just the immediate move count but the overall impact on future moves."

      "content": "You should keep track of the remaining pawns after each turn. Once a pawn is captured, it should no longer be considered in subsequent moves."

      "content": "You may want to create a function to calculate the distance from the knight to each pawn. This will help you determine which pawn to capture next based on the current player's strategy."

      "content": "You may need to implement a recursive function that simulates the game, alternating between Alice's and Bob's turns, while keeping track of the total moves made."
