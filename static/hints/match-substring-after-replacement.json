    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints carefully. The lengths of 's' and 'sub' are up to 5000, and there can be up to 1000 mappings. This means your solution needs to be efficient, possibly around O(n * m) where n is the length of 's' and m is the length of 'sub'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that each character in 'sub' can only be replaced once. This means that if a character in 'sub' can be transformed into multiple characters, you need to track which transformations have already been applied."

      "content": "Before diving into generating all possible versions of 'sub', consider how you would check if a given version of 'sub' is a substring of 's'. You can use Python's 'in' keyword or similar methods in other languages."

      "content": "You might want to build a mapping dictionary from the 2D array for easier access. For example, if mappings = [['e', '3'], ['t', '7']], you could create a dictionary like {'e': ['3'], 't': ['7']}. This will help you apply transformations more easily."
