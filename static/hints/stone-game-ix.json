      "content": "Focus on the modulo operation with respect to 3. Since the losing condition is based on divisibility by 3, think about how the values of the stones can be categorized by their remainders when divided by 3 (0, 1, or 2)."

      "content": "Remember that Alice starts first. This gives her a slight advantage, but how can Bob counter her moves effectively? Think about how the initial moves can set the tone for the rest of the game."
