    {
      "content": "Consider how you might iterate through the list of weights. You will need to check pairs of weights to see if their sum is within the given limit. A simple nested loop could be a starting point."

    {
      "content": "When checking pairs of weights, remember that you need to keep track of the maximum weight that can fit in the two bags without exceeding the limit. Think about initializing a variable to store this maximum weight."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. For example, what happens if there are fewer than two weights in the list? Make sure to handle such edge cases appropriately."

      "content": "As you iterate through the weights, consider using a two-pointer technique or a hash set to optimize your search for pairs that sum to a valid weight. This can help reduce the time complexity."

      "content": "When you find a valid pair of weights that fit within the limit, compare their sum to your current maximum. Update your maximum weight accordingly if this new pair is heavier."

      "content": "Think about how to handle cases where multiple pairs yield the same maximum weight. You should only return the maximum weight, so your logic should account for this."
