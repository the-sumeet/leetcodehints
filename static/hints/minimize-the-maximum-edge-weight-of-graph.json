    {
      "content": "Think about how you can filter edges based on their weights. Since you want to minimize the maximum edge weight, consider sorting the edges by weight and processing them from the lowest to highest."

    {
      "content": "Remember that each node can have at most 'threshold' outgoing edges. As you process edges, keep track of the number of outgoing edges from each node to ensure you do not exceed this limit."

      "content": "Consider using a binary search approach on the maximum edge weight. You can set your search range from the minimum edge weight to the maximum edge weight in the graph."
    },
    {
      "content": "For each weight in your binary search, create a subgraph that includes only edges with weights less than or equal to the current weight. This will help you test if it's possible to reach node 0 from all other nodes."

    {
      "content": "To check if all nodes can reach node 0, you might want to perform a graph traversal (like BFS or DFS) from node 0. Keep track of which nodes can be reached and ensure all nodes are included."

    {
      "content": "While performing the traversal, if you find that some nodes cannot reach node 0, it means the current weight is too low. Adjust your binary search bounds accordingly."

      "content": "If you find that the number of outgoing edges from any node exceeds the threshold, you will need to discard some edges. Think about how you can prioritize which edges to keep based on their weights."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the graph might already satisfy the conditions or where it is impossible to satisfy them. For example, if there are no edges leading to node 0 from certain nodes, it might be impossible to meet the requirements."
