      "content": "Consider how you will identify the greatest value in each row. You can use Python's built-in `max()` function to find the maximum element in a list."

      "content": "Remember that after each operation, the number of columns in the grid decreases by one. This means you will need to modify the grid after removing the maximum values."

      "content": "When you remove the greatest value from a row, ensure you also remove it from the actual grid. You might want to use list manipulation methods like `remove()` or list comprehensions."

      "content": "If multiple maximum values exist in a row, remember that you can remove any one of them. This means your implementation should not depend on the uniqueness of the maximum value."
