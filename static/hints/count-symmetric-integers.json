      "content": "To check if a number is symmetric, you need to split the number into two halves. For example, for a 4-digit number like 1234, the first half is 12 and the second half is 34. How would you extract these two halves?"

    {
      "content": "Once you have the two halves, you need to calculate the sum of the digits in each half. Consider writing a helper function that takes a number and returns the sum of its digits. What would the function look like?"

      "content": "Remember to iterate through all numbers in the given range [low, high]. You can use a simple loop for this. How will you ensure that you only check numbers with an even number of digits?"

      "content": "To efficiently check symmetry, you might want to convert the number to a string. This way, you can easily access individual digits. What methods in Python can you use to convert an integer to a string and access its characters?"

      "content": "After you have your count of symmetric integers, ensure you return this count as the final result. Think about the return type and how you will structure your function to return the count."
