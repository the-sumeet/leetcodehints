      "content": "Consider how the queries are structured. Each query consists of two values: `x_i` and `m_i`. You need to find the maximum XOR value with `x_i` from elements in `nums` that are less than or equal to `m_i`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently filter the `nums` array based on the `m_i` value from each query. A simple approach would be to iterate through `nums` for each query, but that may not be efficient enough for larger inputs."

    {
      "content": "Since `nums` can contain up to 100,000 elements, consider sorting `nums` first. This will allow you to quickly find elements that are less than or equal to `m_i` using binary search."
