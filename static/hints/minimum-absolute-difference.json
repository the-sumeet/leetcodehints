      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find pairs of elements in the array that have the smallest absolute difference. Make sure you grasp the concept of absolute difference: for any two numbers a and b, it's calculated as |a - b|."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would find the minimum absolute difference in a simple way. One approach is to compare each element with every other element. However, this can be inefficient for larger arrays. Think about how sorting the array might help simplify the problem."
    },
    {
      "content": "What happens when you sort the array? After sorting, the smallest absolute difference will only occur between adjacent elements. This means you only need to check the differences between these pairs after sorting."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the sorted array, calculate the absolute differences between each pair of adjacent elements. Keep track of the minimum difference you find as you iterate through the sorted array."

    {
      "content": "As you find the minimum absolute difference, you should also collect the pairs that have this difference. Use a list to store these pairs as you identify them."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the output requires pairs to be in ascending order. Since you are collecting pairs from a sorted array, they will naturally be in the correct order if you ensure that you always store them as [a, b] where a < b."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the array has only two elements. The minimum absolute difference will be the difference between these two elements. Ensure your logic handles this correctly."

      "content": "Make sure to account for the constraints given in the problem. For example, the array contains distinct integers, which means you won't have to deal with duplicate values when calculating differences."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, think about the time complexity. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), and finding pairs takes O(n), making your overall complexity O(n log n). This should be efficient enough given the constraints."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your output format matches the requirements. You need to return a list of pairs, and each pair should be in the format [a, b]. Make sure to test your code with the provided examples to verify correctness."
