      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to flip k consecutive bits in the binary array to turn all bits into 1s. A flip changes 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can track the number of flips. Each time you flip a segment, it affects the next k elements. Think about how to keep track of these changes efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a greedy approach. When you encounter a 0, it makes sense to flip it immediately if you can, as this will help you get closer to your goal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that if you reach the end of the array and there are still 0s left, you must return -1. This indicates that it's impossible to achieve the desired result."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a variable to keep track of the current number of flips. This will help you manage the cumulative effect of flips as you iterate through the array."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle the boundaries of the array. If you are flipping at index i, ensure that you do not exceed the array length when flipping k bits."

    {
      "content": "You could maintain a 'flip effect' array or a running count to determine how many flips are currently affecting each position in the nums array."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you flip at index i, you should also account for the effect of that flip on subsequent indices. This will help you determine if further flips are needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, check the effective value of each index considering the flips that have already occurred. Use this to decide whether to flip at that index."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where k is equal to the length of the array. In such cases, a single flip can change the entire array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently manage the number of flips. You might need to use a queue or a simple counter to track when the effect of a flip ends."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you encounter a 0 and you cannot flip because you're too close to the end of the array (less than k elements left), you should immediately return -1."

      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various cases, including those where no flips are needed, and cases where the array is already all 1s."

    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure your solution runs efficiently within the given constraints. Aim for a linear time complexity solution."

      "content": "To summarize, iterate through the array, decide when to flip based on the current effective value, and keep track of the number of flips. You are very close to the solution!"
