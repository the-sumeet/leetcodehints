      "content": "Remember that the tree is rooted at node 0. This means that when you traverse from any node to its ancestors, you will always be moving towards node 0. Think about how you can keep track of the path taken."

      "content": "The problem requires checking coprimality between the values of nodes. Recall that two numbers are coprime if their greatest common divisor (GCD) is 1. You can use the built-in GCD function in many programming languages to simplify this check."

      "content": "As you traverse the tree, maintain a list or stack of ancestor values. This will help you check the coprimality condition against each ancestor as you move up the tree."
