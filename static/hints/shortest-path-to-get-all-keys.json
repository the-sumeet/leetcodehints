      "content": "Consider how you can represent the state of your search. You might need to keep track of your current position, the keys you have collected, and the grid boundaries to avoid going out of bounds."

      "content": "You need to determine how to track the keys you have collected. A bitmask can be an efficient way to represent the keys you have, especially since there are at most 6 keys."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. BFS is suitable here because you want to find the shortest path to collect all keys, exploring all possible paths equally."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing BFS, use a queue to manage your current position and the state of keys collected. Each entry in the queue can represent a tuple of (current position, keys collected, steps taken)."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you explore the grid, check if the current position contains a key or a lock. If it's a key, update your keys bitmask. If it's a lock, ensure you have the corresponding key before proceeding."
