      "content": "Start by understanding what a palindrome is. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards, like 'racecar' or 'level'. Consider how you can check if a substring is a palindrome."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can generate all possible substrings of the given string. You can use nested loops to extract substrings of different lengths, but remember that this can lead to a lot of checks."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking if a substring is a palindrome, you can compare characters from the start and end of the substring moving towards the center. This can help you avoid unnecessary checks."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the efficiency of your approach. Generating all substrings and checking each one can lead to a time complexity of O(n^3). Can you optimize this?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Look into the concept of expanding around the center. For each character (and each pair of characters), you can try to expand outwards to find the longest palindrome centered at that point."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that palindromes can be of odd or even lengths. When expanding, you should handle both cases: one where the center is a single character and another where the center is between two characters."

      "content": "While expanding, keep track of the longest palindrome you find. You can use two variables to store the start and end indices of this longest palindrome."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as strings with a single character or strings where all characters are the same. These cases can be simple palindromes."

      "content": "Once you find the longest palindrome, remember to return it as a substring of the original string using the start and end indices you tracked earlier."

    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your function handles the input constraints properly. The string length can be up to 1000, so your solution should be efficient enough to handle this size."
