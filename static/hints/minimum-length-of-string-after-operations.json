    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the operation: if you choose a character at index `i`, you must find the closest matching characters to the left and right. This means you need to keep track of character positions as you iterate through the string."

    {
      "content": "Try to visualize the problem with a simple example. For instance, with the string 'aba', if you choose index 1 (the 'b'), you can remove both 'a's. What does the string look like after this operation?"

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find the closest occurrences of a character to the left and right of a given index. You might want to use a data structure that allows you to quickly access and remove characters."

      "content": "Consider using a stack or a list to keep track of characters and their indices as you process the string. This can help you manage the removals more easily."

      "content": "As you perform operations, keep track of which characters are still valid for removal. You may need to mark characters as removed without actually deleting them from the string to avoid index issues."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as strings with no repeating characters or strings that are entirely made of the same character. How would these cases affect your approach?"

      "content": "You might want to simulate the removal process step by step. After each operation, check if further operations can be performed on the resulting string. This could help you identify the minimum length."

    {
      "content": "Consider a two-pointer technique to traverse the string while maintaining a count of characters that can still be removed. This could optimize your solution by avoiding unnecessary checks."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to determine when no more operations can be performed. At this point, you should be able to return the length of the modified string. What condition will you check for to stop the process?"
