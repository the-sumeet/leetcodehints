      "content": "Start by understanding the movement of a knight in chess. A knight can move in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or one square in one direction and then two squares perpendicular. This gives it up to 8 possible moves from any position."

    {
      "content": "Consider the board as a grid where the knight starts at position (0, 0) and needs to reach a target position (x, y). Think about how you can represent the positions on the board using coordinates."

    {
      "content": "Since the knight can jump around the board, the problem can be visualized as a graph traversal problem. You can use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore all possible knight moves from the starting position."

    {
      "content": "When implementing BFS, keep track of the current position and the number of moves taken to reach that position. Use a queue to manage the positions to explore next."

      "content": "Consider the boundaries of the chessboard. A standard chessboard is 8x8, so any position outside of (0, 0) to (7, 7) should be ignored. You can define a function to check if a position is valid."
