      "content": "Consider how you might approach the problem using dynamic programming. You could maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum you can achieve using the first `i` elements of the array."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to calculate the maximum value of a subarray efficiently. You can find the maximum value in a subarray by iterating through it, but remember that the length of the subarray is limited to `k`."

    {
      "content": "When iterating to fill your `dp` array, consider each possible ending index of the subarray. For each `i`, you can look back at most `k` indices to determine the best partitioning point."

      "content": "Keep track of the maximum value found in the current subarray while iterating. For example, if you are at index `i`, you can check indices from `i-k+1` to `i` to find the maximum value."

    {
      "content": "As you fill in the `dp` array, use the formula: `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + max_value * (i - j))` where `j` ranges from `i-k` to `i-1`, and `max_value` is the maximum in the subarray from `j+1` to `i`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when `k` is equal to `1` or when all elements in `arr` are the same. These cases can simplify the problem and help you validate your approach."
