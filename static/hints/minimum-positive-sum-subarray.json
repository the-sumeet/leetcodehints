      "content": "Remember that you need to consider subarrays of lengths between `l` and `r`. Make sure to iterate through the array and check all possible subarrays of these lengths."

      "content": "While iterating, calculate the sum of each subarray. You can use a nested loop: the outer loop can fix the starting point, and the inner loop can vary the length of the subarray."

      "content": "Keep track of the minimum sum found that is greater than 0. Initialize a variable to store this minimum sum, and update it whenever you find a valid subarray."

      "content": "Make sure to check the constraints carefully. The length of the array is between 1 and 100, and the values can range from -1000 to 1000. This means you could potentially have many subarrays to check."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the case when no subarray meets the criteria. You should return -1 in such cases, so ensure your logic accounts for this before returning your result."
