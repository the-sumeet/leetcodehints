    {
      "content": "Consider how you will identify the boundaries of each word. You can iterate through the array and look for spaces to determine where each word starts and ends."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle multiple spaces. For example, if there are consecutive spaces, they should not be treated as words. Make sure your logic accounts for this."

    {
      "content": "Once you have identified the words, you might want to store them in a temporary list or array. This will help you reverse the order of the words more easily."

      "content": "Remember that reversing an array can be done in place. You can use a two-pointer technique to swap elements from the start and end of the list until you reach the middle."

      "content": "After reversing the order of the words, you will need to place them back into the original character array. Ensure that you maintain the spaces correctly."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the case when the input array is empty. An empty array should simply return an empty array without any modifications."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, think about the time complexity. Aim for an O(n) solution, where n is the number of characters in the input array."

      "content": "Finally, once you have reversed the words and placed them back into the array, ensure that you are not introducing any extra spaces between the words."
