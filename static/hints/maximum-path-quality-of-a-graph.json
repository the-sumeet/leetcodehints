    {
      "content": "Each node has a value associated with it. When calculating the quality of a path, you should only count the value of unique nodes visited. This means you need to keep track of which nodes you've already included in your current path."

      "content": "Consider using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from node 0. This approach will allow you to explore different routes while keeping track of the total time spent and the nodes visited."

      "content": "As you explore paths, keep a running total of the time taken. If at any point the total time exceeds `maxTime`, you should stop exploring that path further."

      "content": "Think about how to optimize your DFS. You might want to prune paths that are unlikely to yield a better quality than what you've already found. For instance, if the current quality plus the maximum potential value of unvisited nodes can't exceed the best found, you can stop exploring that path."

      "content": "Keep in mind that you can revisit nodes, but only their values should be counted once. Make sure your logic correctly handles revisiting nodes without adding their values multiple times."
