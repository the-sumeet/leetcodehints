      "content": "Start by understanding what it means for a substring to be valid. A substring of `word1` is valid if it can be rearranged to have `word2` as a prefix. This means the substring must contain at least the same characters as `word2` in the required quantities."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a frequency count for the characters in `word2`. This will help you determine the necessary counts of each character that must be present in any valid substring of `word1`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently check the character counts of substrings of `word1`. A sliding window approach might be useful here, allowing you to maintain a count of characters as you expand and contract the window."

    {
      "content": "Define a sliding window that will represent the current substring of `word1`. You'll need to keep track of the start and end indices of this window as you iterate through `word1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you move the end of the sliding window, update the character count for the current substring. When the window size reaches the length of `word2`, check if the counts match."
    },
    {
      "content": "When the character count of the current window matches the character count of `word2`, it means that this substring can be rearranged to start with `word2`. Count this as a valid substring."

    {
      "content": "When the window is larger than the length of `word2`, move the start of the window forward to maintain the size. Remember to update your character counts accordingly as you slide the window."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where `word1` is shorter than `word2`. In such cases, there can be no valid substrings, so you should return 0 immediately."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle all characters in `word2`. If `word2` contains characters that are not in `word1`, those characters will affect the validity of the substrings."

    {
      "content": "You can use a simple comparison of the frequency maps. If they match, increment your valid substring count. If they don't, you can adjust the window."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the constraints are significant. You need to ensure your solution runs in linear time, O(n), where n is the length of `word1`. This means avoiding nested loops."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the sliding window, consider using two arrays or dictionaries to store character counts for `word2` and the current window in `word1`. This will make comparison straightforward."

      "content": "Don't forget to reset your counts appropriately when moving the start of the window. This is crucial for maintaining accurate counts as you slide through `word1`."
