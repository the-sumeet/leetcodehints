    },
    {
      "content": "The operation allows you to set any index `i` of `arr` to the sum of all current elements in `arr`. Think about how this operation can change the values in `arr`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that the sum of the elements in `arr` will always be at least the number of elements in `arr` (since they all start as 1). This means the target must also be at least the length of the array."

      "content": "Consider the relationship between the maximum element in `target` and the sum of the other elements. How does this relationship affect your ability to reach the target?"
    },
    {
      "content": "If you can construct the target array, the maximum value in `target` must be achievable by summing the other elements. Think about how you could use the current values in `arr` to reach that maximum."

      "content": "You might want to sort the `target` array. This can help you easily identify the largest element and analyze how to reach it through the sums of the others."

    {
      "content": "Think about the condition when you cannot reach a target. For example, if the maximum element is less than the sum of the others, what does that imply?"
    },
    {
      "content": "If at any point the maximum value in `target` is less than or equal to the sum of the rest, you can replace it. But what happens if you reach a point where you cannot replace anymore?"
    },

      "content": "Keep in mind that the operations are reversible in a sense. If you can reach a certain configuration, you can also think about how to backtrack to see if you can reach the original state."

      "content": "When you reach a configuration where you cannot make any more valid moves, how will you determine if you have successfully constructed the target?"
