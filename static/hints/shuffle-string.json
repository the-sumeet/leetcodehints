    {
      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You have a string `s` and an array `indices`. The goal is to rearrange the characters of `s` based on the positions specified in `indices`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can create a new string to hold the shuffled characters. You might want to initialize an empty list or an array of the same length as `s` to store the characters in their new positions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the `indices` array tells you where each character from `s` should go. For example, if `indices[0]` is 4, then the character at `s[0]` should be placed at position 4 in the new string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the characters of `s` using a loop. You can use the index of the loop to access both the character in `s` and its corresponding position in `indices`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you loop through the string, for each character, place it in the new array at the index specified by the corresponding entry in `indices`. Make sure to handle the placement correctly to avoid overwriting any characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "After populating the new array with characters, you will need to convert it back into a string. In Python, you can use `''.join()` to concatenate the list into a single string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the string length is 1. In this case, the output should simply be the same single character, as there are no other positions to shuffle to."
    },
    {
      "content": "Also, ensure that the `indices` array contains unique values. This guarantees that each character from `s` moves to a distinct position in the new string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints provided. The length of `s` and `indices` is guaranteed to be the same, and both will be between 1 and 100. This means your solution can afford to be straightforward without worrying about performance issues."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, put together the logic you've built so far. You might end up with a loop that looks something like this: `for i in range(len(s)):` followed by placing `s[i]` into the new array at `indices[i]`. Don't forget to return the final string!"
