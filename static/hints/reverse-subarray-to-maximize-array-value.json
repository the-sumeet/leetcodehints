    {
      "content": "Start by understanding how the value of the array is calculated. The value is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements. For an array `nums`, this can be expressed as: `value = |nums[0] - nums[1]| + |nums[1] - nums[2]| + ... + |nums[n-2] - nums[n-1]|`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how reversing a subarray affects the absolute differences. When you reverse a subarray, the elements at the boundaries of the subarray will change their positions, which can potentially increase or decrease the overall value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the boundaries of the subarray you might want to reverse. The maximum gain in value will likely come from the differences at the edges of the selected subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the impact of reversing a single element. Reversing a single element doesn't change the array, so you should focus on subarrays of at least two elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "When selecting a subarray to reverse, consider the elements immediately before and after the subarray. The new absolute differences formed after the reversal are crucial for calculating the change in value."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to calculate the initial value of the array before any operations. This will help you understand how much value can be gained by reversing different subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "To maximize the value, you need to evaluate potential subarrays. For each subarray, calculate the change in value that results from reversing it. This involves checking the differences at the boundaries."
    },
    {
      "content": "Use a nested loop to explore all possible subarrays. For each starting index `i` and ending index `j`, compute the change in value when reversing `nums[i:j+1]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that the change in value can be both positive and negative. You should only consider the subarrays that increase the overall value of the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to account for edge cases, such as very small arrays or arrays where all elements are the same. These cases might not yield any increase in value from reversing."
    },
    {
      "content": "After calculating the potential value for each subarray, keep track of the maximum value found. This will be your final answer."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the efficiency of your approach. The naive method of checking all subarrays has a time complexity of O(n^3), which may not be feasible for larger arrays. Look for ways to reduce the number of calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about whether any properties of the absolute difference can help simplify your calculations. For example, how does the order of elements influence the differences?"
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a helper function to calculate the value of the array after reversing a specific subarray. This can help you isolate and test your logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your solution handles all possible edge cases and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement."
