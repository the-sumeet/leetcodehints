      "content": "Consider how to generate subsequences from the array. A subsequence can be formed by including or excluding each element. You can use recursion or iterative methods to explore all possible subsequences."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the input array might contain zeros. A zero in a subsequence will make the product zero, but you need to ensure that the alternating sum condition is still satisfied."

      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The length of the nums array is limited to 150, and the values of the elements range from 0 to 12. This suggests that a brute-force approach might be feasible."
