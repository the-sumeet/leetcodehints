      "content": "Consider the maximum value in the array. If you can't reduce this maximum value to zero, then it's impossible to make all elements zero. How might the size of `k` relate to the maximum value?"

    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the size of `k`. If `k` is equal to the length of the array, what does that allow you to do? Conversely, if `k` is very small, how might that limit your ability to affect all elements?"

    {
      "content": "Explore the idea of a 'sliding window' approach. If you can only decrease elements in a window of size `k`, how can you ensure that all elements are eventually affected? Consider how you might track the operations applied."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `k` is 1. What does this mean for the operations you can perform? Can you make all elements zero in this case?"

      "content": "Think about how you can determine if you can make all elements zero by checking the differences between adjacent elements. If the difference exceeds a certain threshold, can you still make it zero?"
