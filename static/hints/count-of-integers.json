      "content": "Start by understanding the range of integers you need to consider. You are given two strings, num1 and num2, which represent the lower and upper bounds of your range. Convert these strings to integers for easier comparison."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the integers you are counting must satisfy two conditions: they must be between num1 and num2 inclusive, and their digit sum must be between min_sum and max_sum inclusive."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can efficiently calculate the digit sum of an integer. A simple way to do this is to convert the integer to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum them up."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the constraints. The maximum value for num2 can be very large (up to 10^22), which means iterating through each integer in the range might not be feasible due to time complexity."

    {
      "content": "You may want to explore a digit dynamic programming (DP) approach. This technique can help you count valid numbers without generating each one explicitly."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using DP, consider how you can represent the state. You might want to keep track of the current position in the number, the current sum of digits, and whether you are still 'tight' to the bounds defined by num1 and num2."
    },
    {
      "content": "Define your DP function clearly. For instance, a function could take parameters like the current position in the digit, the current digit sum, and a boolean indicating whether the current number is still bounded by num2."

      "content": "Think about the base case for your DP. When you reach the end of the number, check if the digit sum is within the required range [min_sum, max_sum]."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle leading zeros. In your DP, you might want to treat the first digit differently to avoid counting numbers with leading zeros incorrectly."

      "content": "Make sure to incorporate the modulo operation as specified in the problem. Since the result can be large, return your count modulo 10^9 + 7."
    },
    {
      "content": "You will need to call your DP function twice: once for num2 and once for num1 - 1. This will allow you to count all valid integers in the range [num1, num2]."
    },
    {
      "content": "After obtaining counts from both calls, subtract the count from num1 - 1 from the count from num2. This gives you the count of good integers in the desired range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be careful with edge cases, such as when num1 equals num2. In this case, you should directly check if the digit sum of num1 falls within the specified range."

    {
      "content": "Ensure your DP function handles the case where the current digit sum exceeds max_sum early, as this can help prune unnecessary calculations."
