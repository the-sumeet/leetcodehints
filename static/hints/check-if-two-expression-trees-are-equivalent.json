      "content": "Consider the properties of binary trees. Each node can have up to two children, and the arrangement of these nodes is crucial for evaluating expressions correctly. Think about how you would traverse the tree."

      "content": "When comparing two expression trees, you need to check not just the values at each node, but also the structure of the trees. If two trees have the same nodes but different arrangements, they may represent different expressions."

      "content": "A common approach to tree comparison is to use a traversal method, like pre-order or in-order traversal. This allows you to generate a string representation of the tree that can be easily compared."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to null nodes in the trees. They can indicate the absence of children and should be handled carefully during your traversal to avoid false negatives in comparisons."

      "content": "Think about how to handle operator precedence and associativity. For example, the expression 'a + b + c' is equivalent to '(a + b) + c' and 'a + (b + c)'. Your tree structure should reflect this."

    {
      "content": "You might want to create a helper function that takes two nodes as input and returns whether they are equivalent. This function should check the values first and then recursively check the left and right children."

      "content": "Finally, remember to consider all possible configurations of the trees. Two trees can be structurally different but still represent the same expression if they can be rearranged. Ensure your comparison logic accounts for this."
