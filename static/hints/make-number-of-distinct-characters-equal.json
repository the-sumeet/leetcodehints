      "content": "Remember that a swap consists of exchanging one character from `word1` with one character from `word2`. Think about how this swap can affect the counts of distinct characters in both strings."

    {
      "content": "When you swap a character from `word1` with one from `word2`, the distinct character count can either increase or decrease depending on whether the characters being swapped are already present in the other string."

      "content": "Consider the scenario where both strings start with the same number of distinct characters. What happens when you swap a character from one string with a character from the other? How does that affect the distinct counts?"

    {
      "content": "Identify the cases where a swap will not change the distinct character counts. For instance, swapping a character that is already present in the other string will not help in achieving the goal."

    {
      "content": "You can represent the distinct character counts of `word1` and `word2` as `d1` and `d2`. A swap will only be successful if the absolute difference between `d1` and `d2` is 1 or 0, allowing for a possible adjustment."
    },
    {
      "content": "After determining the counts, check the characters that can be swapped. For a valid swap, you should find a character in `word1` that is not in `word2` and vice versa, to ensure that the swap modifies the distinct counts."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement a check that confirms if such a pair of characters exists for a valid swap. If you find at least one valid swap that can equalize the distinct counts, you can return true."
