    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the frequency of each index in `nums` across all requests affects the total sum. You can maintain a count of how many times each index is included in any request. This will help you determine which numbers should be placed in higher-value positions in the permutation."

    {
      "content": "To calculate the frequency of each index, iterate through the `requests` array and for each request, increment the count for the indices from `start` to `end`. This will give you an array that tells you how many times each index is referenced."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the frequency counts, sort the `nums` array in descending order. This way, you can maximize the sum by placing the largest numbers in the most frequently requested indices."

      "content": "After sorting, create a new array where each index's value is determined by multiplying the sorted `nums` value by its corresponding frequency count. This will give you the total contribution of each index to the final sum."

    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. You should aim for a solution that is efficient enough to handle the upper constraints of the problem, particularly since both `nums` and `requests` can be as large as 100,000."
