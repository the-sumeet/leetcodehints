      "content": "Consider the implications of closing a branch. When a branch is closed, all roads connected to it are also removed. Think about how this affects the connectivity of the remaining branches."

      "content": "Visualize the branches and roads as a graph where branches are nodes and roads are edges with weights. This will help you analyze distances between branches more effectively."

      "content": "You need to find sets of branches that can be closed while ensuring that the remaining branches are still connected within the 'maxDistance'. How can you represent this condition mathematically?"
