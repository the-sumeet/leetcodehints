      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the subarrays you need to check. Each subarray must be of size `m + 1`, where `m` is the length of the `pattern`. This means you will be checking segments of the `nums` array that have a length of `m + 1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to iterate through the `nums` array. You will need to check subarrays starting from each index `i` such that `i + m < n`. This ensures you do not go out of bounds."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the `pattern` can contain three values: -1, 0, and 1. Each value corresponds to a specific comparison between consecutive elements in the `nums` array. Make sure you understand what each value signifies."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the pattern value `1`, you need to check if `nums[i + k + 1] > nums[i + k]`. For `0`, check if they are equal, and for `-1`, check if the next element is less than the current one. Think about how you can implement these checks in a loop."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the `nums` array, you will need to maintain a count of how many subarrays match the `pattern`. Initialize a counter at the start of your function to keep track of valid matches."

    {
      "content": "When checking a subarray, you can use a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through possible starting indices and the inner loop checks the conditions specified by the `pattern`. Make sure to break out of the inner loop if any condition fails."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `nums` contains repeated elements. The pattern `[0]` would require you to handle equality checks carefully."

      "content": "Consider how to optimize your solution. Instead of checking all elements for every subarray, you might be able to keep track of the last valid index or use a sliding window approach."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where `m` is at its minimum value, which is 1. This means you will be looking for pairs of elements in `nums`, which simplifies your checks."

      "content": "If `nums` is sorted, think about how the pattern might affect your checks. For example, a pattern of all `1`s would always yield valid subarrays if `nums` is strictly increasing."
