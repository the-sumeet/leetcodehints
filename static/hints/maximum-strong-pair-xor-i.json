    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the condition |x - y| <= min(x, y). For example, if x = 5 and y = 3, then |5 - 3| = 2, and min(5, 3) = 3. Since 2 <= 3, (5, 3) is a strong pair."

      "content": "You can select the same integer twice to form a pair, which means pairs like (x, x) are valid strong pairs. This could simplify your search for maximum XOR values."

      "content": "When calculating the XOR, be mindful of the properties of XOR: x XOR x = 0, which means pairs like (x, x) will not contribute to the maximum XOR unless x is 0."
