      "content": "Consider how you can form a palindrome using the digits in the string. You will need to count the occurrences of each digit to determine how many can be used in the palindrome."

      "content": "Remember that a palindrome is symmetric. This means that for each digit used on one side of the center, you need to have a matching digit on the other side."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the digits with odd counts. You can use one of these digits as the center of the palindrome, but only one digit can occupy this central position."

      "content": "Once you have your left half and potentially a middle digit, combine them to form the full palindrome. Remember to mirror the left half to complete the structure."
