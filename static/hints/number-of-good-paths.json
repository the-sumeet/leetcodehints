      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the tree. A tree is a connected graph with no cycles, which means there is exactly one path between any two nodes. This property will be crucial for finding good paths."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on the definition of a good path. Remember, a good path starts and ends at nodes with the same value, and all intermediate nodes must have values less than or equal to the starting node's value."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the tree using the given edges. You can use an adjacency list to store the connections between nodes. This will help you traverse the tree easily."

      "content": "Think about how to traverse the tree. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are both suitable methods to explore all paths from a given starting node."

    {
      "content": "When traversing, keep track of the current node's value. If you encounter a node with a value greater than the starting node's value, you should stop exploring that path further."

      "content": "Remember that single nodes count as good paths. This means that for every node, you can initially count it as one good path."

      "content": "To avoid counting the same path multiple times, ensure that you only consider paths in one direction, or use a set to track visited paths."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to group nodes by their values. You can create a mapping from each value to the list of nodes that have that value. This will help you efficiently find potential starting and ending nodes for good paths."
    },
    {
      "content": "While exploring paths, maintain a count of how many nodes you encounter that have the same value as the starting node. This will help you calculate the number of good paths that can be formed."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when all nodes have the same value or when the tree is very small (like just one node). How do these cases affect your counting of good paths?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When you find a good path, consider the number of ways to choose pairs of nodes that can form good paths. For example, if there are three nodes with the same value, you can form multiple paths among them."
