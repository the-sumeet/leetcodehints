      "content": "Notice that the labeling alternates direction based on the row number. For odd rows, the labels increase from left to right, while for even rows, they decrease from right to left. This means you'll need to determine the row of the given label."

      "content": "To find the row of a node with a given label, observe that the number of nodes in the first 'n' rows is given by the formula: `2^n - 1`. You can find the row by determining the largest 'n' such that `2^n - 1 < label`."
