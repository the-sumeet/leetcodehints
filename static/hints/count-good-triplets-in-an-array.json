      "content": "Start by understanding the concept of a good triplet. A good triplet consists of three distinct values (x, y, z) such that their positions in both nums1 and nums2 are in increasing order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that both nums1 and nums2 are permutations of the same set of numbers. This means that each number from 0 to n-1 appears exactly once in each array."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the positions of each number in nums1 and nums2, you can create two dictionaries (or arrays) that map each number to its index in the respective array."
    },
    {
      "content": "For example, if nums1 = [2, 0, 1, 3], then the position mapping for nums1 would be: {2: 0, 0: 1, 1: 2, 3: 3}."

    {
      "content": "Next, focus on how to iterate through all possible triplets (x, y, z). You can use three nested loops to generate all combinations of indices, but this approach might be inefficient for larger n."

    {
      "content": "Instead of using three nested loops, consider how you can reduce the complexity. You might want to fix one number and then look for valid pairs among the remaining numbers."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently count the number of valid pairs (y, z) for each fixed x. This could involve using data structures that allow you to maintain order, such as a Fenwick Tree or a Segment Tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you process each number, keep track of how many numbers have been seen so far in the second array (nums2) to help you count valid pairs quickly."

    },
    {
      "content": "When counting pairs, remember that the order matters. You need to ensure that for each selected x, the indices for y and z are strictly greater than the index for x in both nums1 and nums2."

      "content": "Consider using combinations of indices and filtering them based on their positions in nums1 and nums2. This could simplify your counting process."

    {
      "content": "A potential optimization is to sort the indices based on their positions in one of the arrays before processing them for the other array. This can help in quickly finding valid pairs."
