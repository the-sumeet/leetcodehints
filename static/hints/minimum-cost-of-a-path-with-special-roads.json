      "content": "Consider how you can represent the problem as a graph where nodes are points in the 2D space and edges are the costs associated with moving between those points. Each special road can be viewed as a directed edge with a specific cost."

    {
      "content": "Don't forget that you can move freely in the 2D space, not just along special roads. This means you should always evaluate the cost of moving directly to a point before opting for a special road."

    {
      "content": "When processing each special road, ensure you only consider it if you can reach its starting point from your current position. Calculate the cost to get to the starting point of the road, then add the special road's cost, and finally the cost to reach the target from the end of the road."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, ensure that you handle special roads that may not be directly usable (e.g., if the starting point is not reachable). This requires careful validation of the coordinates."

      "content": "Finally, think about how to return the result. The output should be the minimum cost to reach the target from the start, considering all possible paths, including special roads."
