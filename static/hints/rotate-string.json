    {
      "content": "Think about the length of both strings. If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are not equal, then it's impossible for `s` to become `goal` through any number of shifts."

      "content": "Check if both strings contain the same characters with the same frequency. This is a necessary condition for one string to be a rotation of another. You can use a frequency count or sorting for this."

      "content": "Consider how you can simulate the shifting process. One way is to concatenate the string `s` with itself. For example, if `s = 'abcde'`, then `s + s = 'abcdeabcde'`."

      "content": "When checking if `goal` is a substring of `s + s`, make sure to use the appropriate string methods available in your programming language. For example, in Python, you can use the `in` keyword."

      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, write out test cases that cover various scenarios, such as identical strings, completely different strings, and strings that are rotations of each other."
