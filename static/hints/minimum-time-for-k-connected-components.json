      "content": "Consider the case when k equals n. What does it mean for the graph to have k connected components? In this scenario, each node must be its own component, so you might not need to remove any edges."

    {
      "content": "When k is less than n, you need to think about how to efficiently determine the number of connected components as edges are removed. You can use a union-find (disjoint set union) data structure to help manage and track connected components."

    {
      "content": "Sort the edges based on their removal time. This will allow you to process the edges in the order they are removed, which is crucial for determining the state of the graph at any given time."

      "content": "As you iterate through the sorted edges, keep track of the number of connected components. Start with the initial number of components and decrease it as you remove edges that connect two previously connected components."

      "content": "When checking if the number of components has reached k, make sure to keep track of the minimum time at which this occurs. You might want to use a variable to store this minimum time."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the graph starts off as disconnected. For example, if there are isolated nodes, they already count as separate components. This can affect your calculations significantly."
