      "content": "Think about how you can identify if two strings are anagrams. One approach is to sort the characters in each string and compare the sorted results. If they are the same, the strings are anagrams."

      "content": "Consider how you would group the anagrams. You might want to use a data structure like a dictionary (or hashmap) where the key is the sorted string and the value is a list of strings that are anagrams of that key."
