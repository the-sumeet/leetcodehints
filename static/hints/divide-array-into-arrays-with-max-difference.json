      "content": "Start by understanding the constraints of the problem. The array size `n` is always a multiple of 3, which means you will be dividing the array into groups of 3 elements. This is crucial for your implementation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the maximum difference `k` affects the elements in each group. If you sort the array first, it can help you easily check if the difference between the smallest and largest elements in a group is within `k`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can group the sorted elements into subarrays of size 3. After sorting, you can iterate through the array in steps of 3 to form these groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you create each group, check if the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the group exceeds `k`. If it does, you should return an empty array as it's impossible to satisfy the condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking the differences, remember that you can use the first and last elements of the group after sorting to determine the difference: `if group[2] - group[0] > k`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all elements are the same or when the array has a mix of very close and very far numbers. This can help you validate your solution against possible inputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "After forming a valid group, add it to a result list. Make sure to initialize this list before you start grouping elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you reach the end of the array and all groups are valid, return the result list. Otherwise, ensure you handle the case where a valid grouping isn't possible."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the output should be a 2D array. Each group of 3 should be a separate array within the main array. Keep this format in mind while constructing your result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, try implementing your logic step by step. Start with sorting the array, then create a loop to form groups of 3, checking the difference condition as you go. This will help you build your solution incrementally."
