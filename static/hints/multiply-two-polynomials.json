      "content": "Consider how to multiply two polynomials. Recall that when you multiply two terms, you multiply their coefficients and add their exponents. For instance, (3x^2) * (4) results in 12x^2."

    {
      "content": "Think about the size of the output array. If the first polynomial has degree m and the second has degree n, the resulting polynomial will have a degree of m+n. Therefore, the output array should have a length of m+n+1."
