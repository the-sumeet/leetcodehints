      "content": "Notice that the smallest element in the 'sums' array should be 0, as the sum of the empty subset is always 0. This will help you identify valid elements of the unknown array."

      "content": "The largest element in the 'sums' array should be the sum of all elements in the unknown array. This gives you a clue about the potential values in your unknown array."

      "content": "When you extract an element from the sums array to form part of your unknown array, you need to consider how this affects the remaining subset sums. Each time you add an element, you are effectively generating new subset sums."
