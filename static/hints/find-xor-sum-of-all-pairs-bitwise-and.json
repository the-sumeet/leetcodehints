      "content": "Remember that the bitwise AND operation can yield results that are less than or equal to the smallest operand. For example, `3 AND 6` results in `2`."

      "content": "Instead of storing all results, you can directly compute the XOR sum while iterating through the pairs. This will save memory and potentially improve performance."
