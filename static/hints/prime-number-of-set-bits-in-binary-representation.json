      "content": "Start by understanding how to convert an integer to its binary representation. You can use built-in functions in many programming languages to achieve this. For example, in Python, you can use `bin(num)` to get the binary string of `num`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the binary representation, focus on counting the number of set bits (1's). You can do this by iterating through the binary string and counting the '1' characters, or using a function like `str.count('1')` in Python."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the task requires you to check if the count of set bits is a prime number. Make sure you are familiar with what constitutes a prime number: it is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to efficiently check if a number is prime. You can create a helper function that checks for factors up to the square root of the number to determine if it is prime."

    {
      "content": "You will need to iterate through all numbers in the inclusive range [left, right]. For each number, calculate the number of set bits and check if that count is prime. Keep a counter to track how many numbers meet the criteria."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `left` and `right` are the same. In this case, you will only check one number. Ensure your function handles this scenario correctly."

      "content": "To optimize, consider precomputing the prime status for all possible counts of set bits that can occur in the range. For example, the maximum number of set bits for numbers up to 1,000,000 is limited, so you can use a sieve method to determine which counts are prime."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, make sure to test it with edge cases, such as the smallest range (1 to 1) and the largest range (1 to 1,000,000). This will help ensure your solution is robust."
