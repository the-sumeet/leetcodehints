      "content": "To find the distinct elements in the array, you can use a set. This will help you quickly determine how many unique elements are in the entire array. For example, in `nums = [1, 3, 1, 2, 2]`, the distinct elements are `{1, 2, 3}`."

      "content": "Consider how you would generate all possible subarrays. A subarray can be defined by its starting and ending indices. You can use nested loops to iterate through all possible starting and ending points in the array."
