    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the movement rules: you can only move right or down when going to the bottom-right corner, and left or up when returning to the top-left corner. This creates two distinct paths that you need to analyze."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the paths through the grid. You might want to use a depth-first search (DFS) or dynamic programming approach to explore all possible routes while collecting cherries."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you collect cherries from a cell, it becomes empty (0). This means that the second trip back home could potentially collect fewer cherries if you revisit cells. Keep track of the state of the grid as you collect cherries."

      "content": "Before diving into coding, consider edge cases. For instance, what happens if the grid is filled with thorns (-1) except for the start and end points? How would you handle this situation?"

    {
      "content": "You need to check if there is a valid path from (0, 0) to (n-1, n-1) before attempting to collect cherries. If thereâ€™s no valid path, the maximum number of cherries collected will be zero."

      "content": "As you explore the grid, maintain a count of cherries collected and ensure you are not revisiting cells unnecessarily. Use a visited set or boolean array to track your path."

      "content": "When implementing your solution, think about how to handle the grid after the first trip. You may want to create a copy of the grid or modify it in a way that reflects the cherries collected."
