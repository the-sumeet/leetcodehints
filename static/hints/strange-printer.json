      "content": "Think about how you can minimize the number of turns. If you have consecutive characters that are the same, you can print them in one turn. For example, in 'aaabbb', you can print 'aaa' in one turn."

      "content": "What happens if there are characters that are not consecutive? For example, in 'aba', you have 'a', 'b', and 'a' again. You need to think about how to cover these characters efficiently."
