    {
      "content": "Consider what it means for the string to revert to its initial state. The goal is to find a sequence of operations that will return the string to its original configuration. This means you should track how the string changes with each operation."

    {
      "content": "Notice that the string's length remains constant throughout the operations since you remove and add the same number of characters (`k`). This can simplify your calculations as you won't have to worry about changing string lengths."

    {
      "content": "Think about the relationship between the prefix you remove and the suffix you add. If you add the same characters you removed, how does that affect the string? This could lead to a quicker return to the initial state."

      "content": "Consider the case where `k` is equal to the length of the string. What happens in this scenario? This might give you insight into edge cases and how they impact the time needed to revert to the initial state."

      "content": "To optimize your solution, think about how the string transforms after each operation. You might want to use a loop that continues until the string matches its original state again, counting the seconds as you go."

      "content": "If you find that after a certain number of operations the string has not reverted to its initial state, consider the possibility of a cycle. You may need to track previous states to detect cycles and avoid infinite loops."

      "content": "Finally, think about how you would implement the logic in code. You will likely need a loop, a way to keep track of the current state of the string, and a counter for the number of seconds.
