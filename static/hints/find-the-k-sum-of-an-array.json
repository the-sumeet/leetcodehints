      "content": "Remember that the empty subsequence has a sum of 0. This means that 0 should be included in your list of possible sums."

      "content": "When generating subsequence sums, keep track of each sum you compute. You can use a set to avoid duplicates initially, but remember that duplicates are allowed in the final result."

      "content": "If you're using a heap, once you have k elements, the smallest element in the heap will be your k-th largest sum. Make sure to return that correctly."
