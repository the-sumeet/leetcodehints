    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the first condition. If you have a column of cells, all cells in that column must be the same value. This means for each column, you can only choose one unique value for all cells."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the second condition, think about how the values in each row must differ from one another. This means that if you have multiple columns, the values in adjacent columns must not be the same."

    {
      "content": "To minimize operations, focus on how many changes you need to make in each column to ensure all cells are equal. You might want to count the frequency of each number in each column to determine the most common value."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the most common value for each column, calculate how many cells need to be changed to match this value. This will give you the number of operations required for that column."

      "content": "After determining the operations for each column, think about how to adjust the values in adjacent columns to satisfy the second condition. You may need to alternate values between columns."

      "content": "As you work through the grid, keep track of the total number of operations needed. Make sure to account for both conditions simultaneously, as changing one value might affect others."

      "content": "Think about how you can represent the final grid structure. If you have a column of values that are the same, how can you ensure that the adjacent columns have different values? This might involve some strategic choices."
