      "content": "Consider how to compute the sum of all possible subsequences. You don't need to generate all subsequences explicitly; think about how each element contributes to different subsequences based on its inclusion or exclusion."

      "content": "Remember that the sum of a subsequence can be influenced by the presence of multiple elements. If you include an element in a subsequence, it adds its value to the sum. How can you efficiently track which elements contribute to the total sum?"
