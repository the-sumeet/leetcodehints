      "content": "When implementing Dijkstra's algorithm, remember to use a priority queue to efficiently get the next node with the smallest distance. This will help you manage the exploration of nodes effectively."

      "content": "As you calculate the shortest paths, keep track of the distances in an array or dictionary. This will allow you to easily reference the distance to each node later when checking against the marked nodes."
