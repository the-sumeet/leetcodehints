      "content": "Consider the smallest cases first. For example, if n = 1 and k = 1, how many arrangements are possible? This will help you grasp the concept of visibility."

      "content": "Think about the implications of having k visible sticks. If k = n, then all sticks must be arranged in increasing order. What happens if k is less than n?"

      "content": "Consider using combinatorial mathematics. The problem can be related to choosing which sticks will be visible and how to arrange the remaining sticks."

      "content": "You can think of the problem in terms of permutations. If you know how many sticks are visible, how can you arrange the remaining sticks so that they do not affect visibility?"

      "content": "Remember that the lengths of the sticks are unique integers from 1 to n. This uniqueness is crucial because it simplifies the counting of arrangements."

      "content": "Explore the concept of 'inversions' in permutations. An inversion occurs when a larger stick is placed before a smaller stick. How does this relate to visibility?"
