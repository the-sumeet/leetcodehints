      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement. You need to paint houses such that no two adjacent houses have the same color. Each house has a cost associated with each color."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would represent the costs for each house. You can think of a 2D array where each row corresponds to a house and each column corresponds to a color."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to minimize the total cost. This means you should keep track of the costs as you make decisions about which color to paint each house."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You will likely need to maintain a state that represents the minimum cost to paint up to a certain house."
    },
    {
      "content": "When evaluating the cost for painting a house, ensure that you are not considering the cost of the same color for the previous house. This is crucial to avoid adjacent houses having the same color."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider maintaining a variable to store the minimum and second minimum costs of the previous house. This will help you efficiently compute the current house's cost."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may need to iterate through each house and for each color, decide the minimum cost based on the previous house's costs. Think about how to structure this loop."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, such as when there is only one house or when all costs are the same. How would your approach change in these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the minimum cost for a house, if the previous house was painted a certain color, you should use the second minimum cost instead. This avoids the same color being used."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to initialize your variables correctly, especially for the first house. The costs for the first house will directly come from the input array."
    },
    {
      "content": "After processing all houses, the final answer will be the minimum cost from the last house's computed costs. Ensure you are returning the correct format as specified."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will handle the input and output. The input is a 2D array, and your output should be a single integer representing the minimum cost."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your solution. A naive approach may lead to exponential time complexity, so aim for a more efficient O(n * k) solution where n is the number of houses and k is the number of colors."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, add debug statements to track the costs at each step. This will help you identify any logical errors in your approach."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution is robust by testing with various edge cases, such as houses with only one color or very large cost values."
