This means that if you pick any element, all elements to the right are greater, and all elements below are greater."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you might navigate the matrix. A good approach is to start from one of the corners of the matrix. For example, starting from the top-right corner can be beneficial because you can easily decide whether to move left or down based on the comparison with the target."

    {
      "content": "Think about the decision-making process when you compare the current element with the target. If the current element is equal to the target, you've found it! If it's greater, you can eliminate that column. If it's less, you can eliminate that row."
