      "content": "Remember that you can halve the prices of non-adjacent nodes before starting your trips. Think about how this choice can affect the total price sum of the trips."

      "content": "Consider how the trips are defined. Each trip has a start and an end node. You will need to find the path between these two nodes in the tree and calculate the price sum along that path."

      "content": "To find the path between two nodes in a tree, you might want to use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS). This will help you explore all possible paths from the start node to the end node."

      "content": "When you calculate the price sum for a path, remember to account for the prices of all nodes on that path. If you decide to halve the price of certain nodes, make sure to apply this change before calculating the sum."

      "content": "Think about the implications of halving prices. If you halve the price of a node, it will affect all trips that include that node in their path. Consider how many trips a node is involved in when deciding which nodes to halve."

    {
      "content": "Since the tree has a maximum of 50 nodes, you can afford to explore different combinations of nodes to halve their prices. However, be mindful of the constraint that the nodes you choose to halve must be non-adjacent."
