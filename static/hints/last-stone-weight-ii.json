      "content": "Consider the implications of the order in which you smash the stones. The result can vary based on the choice of stones. Think about how you can systematically explore different combinations of stones."

      "content": "Remember that the maximum weight of a single stone is 100, and there can be at most 30 stones. This means the total weight can be at most 3000, which is manageable for a dynamic programming solution."

      "content": "Define a DP array where dp[j] is true if a weight j can be achieved using some subset of stones. Initialize dp[0] to true, since a weight of 0 can always be achieved with no stones."
