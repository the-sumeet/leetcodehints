      "content": "Consider the concept of penalty defined in the problem. The penalty is determined by the maximum number of balls in any bag after performing the allowed operations. Think about how splitting bags affects this maximum value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that the operations allow you to split a bag into two smaller bags. This means that you can reduce the size of the largest bag, but you need to manage how many splits you can perform (up to maxOperations)."
    },
    {
      "content": "To minimize the penalty, you might want to focus on the largest bag first. Think about how many times you can divide a bag of size `x` into smaller bags and what the resulting sizes would be."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a binary search approach to determine the minimum possible penalty. Define a search range for the penalty from `1` to the maximum value in `nums`. This will help you efficiently narrow down the possible penalties."
    },
    {
      "content": "In your binary search, for a given penalty `mid`, you need to check if it is feasible to reduce all bags to have at most `mid` balls. This involves counting how many operations are needed to achieve this."
    },
    {
      "content": "To check if a penalty `mid` is feasible, iterate through each bag in `nums`. For a bag with `x` balls, if `x` is greater than `mid`, calculate how many splits are necessary to bring it down to `mid` or fewer balls."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the number of operations needed for a bag with `x` balls, you can use the formula: `ceil(x / mid) - 1`. This gives you the number of splits required to ensure all resulting bags have at most `mid` balls."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases: if `maxOperations` is greater than or equal to the total number of bags, you can always reduce the penalty to `1` since you can keep splitting until all bags have one ball."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the binary search, ensure that you correctly update your search range based on whether the current `mid` penalty is feasible or not. If feasible, try a smaller penalty; if not, increase it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, once you have your binary search set up correctly, make sure to return the smallest feasible penalty found. This will be the minimum possible penalty after performing the allowed operations."
