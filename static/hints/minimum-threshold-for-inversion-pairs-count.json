      "content": "Start by understanding what an inversion pair is. An inversion pair occurs when a larger number appears before a smaller number in the array. For example, in the array [3, 1, 2], the pairs (3,1) and (3,2) are inversions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you might count these inversion pairs. A brute-force approach would involve two nested loops, checking each pair of elements. This would have a time complexity of O(n^2)."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider whether you can optimize your approach. There is a well-known algorithm that counts inversions in O(n log n) time using a modified merge sort. This might be a good direction to explore."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to handle edge cases. For example, what happens if the array is empty or contains only one element? In these cases, the count of inversion pairs should be zero."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the input format. The problem states that you will receive an array of integers and an integer threshold. Ensure you understand how to interpret the threshold in relation to the inversion pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will return the result. The problem might require you to return the count of inversion pairs that are greater than or equal to the given threshold. Make sure your final output format matches the requirements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently store and count the inversion pairs. You might need to use a data structure that allows you to keep track of counts as you merge the sorted halves in your modified merge sort."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing the merge sort, remember that you can count inversions during the merge step. Each time you take an element from the right half before taking an element from the left half, you can count how many elements remain in the left half."
    },
    {
      "content": "After counting the total inversions, you will need to compare this count with the given threshold. If the count is greater than or equal to the threshold, you may need to return true or some specific value based on the problem's requirements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure you test your implementation with various test cases, including edge cases like arrays with all identical elements, already sorted arrays, and arrays with negative numbers. This will help verify the correctness of your solution."
