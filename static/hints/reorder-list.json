      "content": "Consider how you can split the list into two halves. You can use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the list. This will help you separate the first half from the second half."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the two halves, think about how you can reverse the second half of the list. Reversing the second half will allow you to interleave the nodes from the two halves in the required order."

      "content": "After reversing the second half, you will have two pointers: one for the first half and one for the reversed second half. Plan how to iterate through both halves simultaneously to rearrange the nodes."
