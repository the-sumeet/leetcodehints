      "content": "To start, understand what the diameter of a tree is. The diameter is the longest path between any two nodes in the tree. Think about how you can represent the tree structure in your code."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the tree using an adjacency list or an edge list. For instance, in the input [[0,1],[0,2]], you can visualize that node 0 connects to nodes 1 and 2."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that trees are acyclic and connected. This means you won't have any cycles, and there is exactly one path between any two nodes. How does this property help in finding the diameter?"
    },
    {
      "content": "A common approach to find the diameter is to use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Think about how you might implement one of these traversals to explore the tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can find the diameter by performing two passes of DFS/BFS. First, start from any arbitrary node and find the farthest node from it. Then, from that farthest node, perform another DFS/BFS to find the maximum distance to any node."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your DFS/BFS, keep track of the distance from the starting node to each node you visit. This will help you identify the farthest node effectively."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the tree has only one node or is a straight line. What should your function return in these cases? Make sure to handle these scenarios correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure you are aware of the input format and constraints. The input is a list of edges, and you need to ensure that your implementation can handle varying sizes of input efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the two-pass approach, remember to store the maximum distance found during the second DFS/BFS. This value will represent the diameter of the tree."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the diameter as an integer. You might want to test your solution with various tree shapes to confirm its correctness."

    "Input is given as a list of edges, where each edge connects two nodes.",
    "The tree is undirected, meaning the edges do not have a direction.",
    "The input can represent trees of varying sizes, including edge cases like a single node.",
    "The output should be a single integer representing the diameter of the tree."
