      "content": "Start by understanding what 'shifted strings' means. Two strings are considered shifted if you can transform one into the other by shifting the characters in a circular manner. For example, 'abc' can be shifted to 'bcd'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the shift between characters. One way to do this is to calculate the difference in their ASCII values. For instance, the difference between 'b' and 'a' is 1."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to group the strings. You might want to use a data structure that allows you to group strings based on their shift pattern. A dictionary or a list of lists could work well for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "When comparing two strings, you can derive a 'shift key' that represents their shift pattern. For example, for 'abc' and 'bcd', the shift key could be calculated as the difference between the first characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as strings of different lengths. If two strings are of different lengths, they cannot be shifted versions of each other, so you can skip them."

    {
      "content": "You may want to normalize the shift key. For instance, if the shift from 'a' to 'b' is 1, the shift from 'b' to 'c' is also 1. Consider how you can represent this consistently for all characters."

    {
      "content": "As you build your grouping logic, think about how to store the results. You might want to use a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings that are grouped together as shifted strings."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the input list, ensure that you are not comparing strings that have already been grouped. You can use a set to keep track of which strings have been processed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have your groups, remember to return them in the required format. The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the grouped shifted strings."

      "content": "Consider the final implementation details, such as how to handle empty strings or single-character strings. They should still be included in the output as their own groups."
