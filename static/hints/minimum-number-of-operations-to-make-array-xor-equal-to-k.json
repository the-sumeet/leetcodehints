      "content": "Calculate the initial XOR of all elements in the array. This will help you determine how far you are from achieving the target k. You can do this with a simple loop: `current_xor = nums[0]` and then `current_xor ^= nums[i]` for each element."

      "content": "Consider the relationship between the current XOR and k. If the current XOR is already equal to k, you won't need to perform any operations. Can you think of a way to check this condition early?"

      "content": "Now, consider how many bits are different between `current_xor` and `k`. You can use the XOR operation to find this: `diff_bits = needed_change`. The number of 1s in this result indicates how many bits differ."
