    {
      "content": "Consider the geometry of the circles. Each circle defined by (xi, yi, ri) has a center at (xi, yi) and a radius of ri. This means any point within a distance of ri from (xi, yi) is considered inside the circle and thus not valid for your path."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the edges of the rectangle. The path must only touch the rectangle at the corners (0, 0) and (xCorner, yCorner). This means the path can’t intersect the rectangle's sides except at these points."
    },
    {
      "content": "Check the constraints carefully. The coordinates of the rectangle can be very large (up to 10^9), which implies that a brute force approach checking every point is not feasible. You need an efficient way to determine if a path exists."

      "content": "Identify the areas of the rectangle that are safe from the circles. For each circle, calculate the area that is 'unsafe' by considering the distance from the circle's center to the edges of the rectangle."

      "content": "You might want to use a graph traversal technique to explore the space. Consider using BFS or DFS to explore potential paths from the starting point to the destination while avoiding the circles."

    {
      "content": "Before implementing the pathfinding algorithm, ensure you can efficiently check if a point is inside any circle. This can be done using the distance formula: a point (px, py) is inside a circle if (px - xi)^2 + (py - yi)^2 < ri^2."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases where circles might be very close to the rectangle's corners. For instance, if a circle is centered at (0, 0) with a radius that reaches the origin, this would immediately invalidate the path."

      "content": "Consider the case where multiple circles overlap or are very close to each other. You will need to account for the combined effect of these circles when determining safe areas."

      "content": "As you explore paths, consider the boundaries created by the circles. You may need to adjust your pathfinding logic to ensure that you are not just avoiding the circles but also staying within the rectangle."
