      "content": "Start by understanding the operations you can perform on the string. Each second, you remove the first `k` characters and add `k` characters to the end. This means the string's length remains constant."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the effect of the operations on the string. If you remove characters from the front and add characters to the back, the string is effectively being rotated. Think about how this rotation can lead to the original string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the length of the string `n`. The operations will cycle through the string, so the total number of unique states you can achieve is limited by `n`. This will help you find when the string returns to its initial state."

      "content": "Notice that if `k` is equal to `n`, the string will revert to its original state in just one operation. This is a special case that can simplify your calculations."

    {
      "content": "Think about the string as a circular buffer. Each operation shifts the starting point of the string. The challenge is to determine how many operations it takes to return to the original starting point."

    {
      "content": "To optimize, think about the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `n` and `k`. The number of unique states you can reach before returning to the original state is influenced by this GCD."

    {
      "content": "If you can find the cycle length using GCD, you can then calculate how many operations it takes to complete that cycle. This will give you the minimum time needed."
