      "content": "Think about how you can preprocess the array to make answering the queries faster. One common technique is to use a prefix XOR array, where each element at index `i` contains the XOR of all elements from the start of the array to `i`."

      "content": "If you create a prefix XOR array, you can compute the XOR for any subarray `arr[left]` to `arr[right]` using this formula: `prefixXOR[right] XOR prefixXOR[left - 1]`. Make sure to handle the case when `left` is 0."
