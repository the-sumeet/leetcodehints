      "content": "Next, pay attention to the initial positions of the squirrels provided in the inputs. These positions are crucial as they represent where the squirrels start their journey on the grid. Remember that these positions are given as coordinates in the format [row, column]."

    {
      "content": "Consider how the squirrels will move. You need to define the possible movements for the squirrels. Typically, they can move in four directions: up, down, left, and right. Think about how you can represent these movements programmatically."

    {
      "content": "When processing the squirrel movements, ensure that you check for boundaries. Squirrels should not move outside the grid dimensions. Implement boundary checks to avoid indexing errors."

      "content": "The input also includes a list of obstacles. These obstacles will affect the movement of the squirrels. Make sure to store these in a way that allows you to easily check if a squirrel's next move is valid or blocked."

      "content": "As you simulate the movements, consider how to keep track of each squirrel's position after every move. You might want to use a data structure like a list or a dictionary to store their current positions."

      "content": "Think about how you will handle multiple squirrels. If two squirrels end up in the same position after a move, you need to decide how to handle this scenario. Will they share the position, or will one be prioritized over the other?"

      "content": "Remember to account for edge cases, such as when all squirrels are blocked by obstacles and cannot move. Your simulation should handle these situations gracefully, ensuring that the output reflects the final positions of the squirrels accurately."

    {
      "content": "As you approach the end of the simulation, determine how you will format the output. The expected output should clearly indicate the final positions of all squirrels after all possible moves have been made."

      "content": "Finally, implement a way to check for termination conditions in your simulation. You might want to stop the simulation when no more valid moves are possible for any squirrel. This will ensure that you aren't running the simulation indefinitely."
