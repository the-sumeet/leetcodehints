      "content": "Consider how many times you can perform each operation. You can only use Operation 1 up to `op1` times and Operation 2 up to `op2` times, and you cannot use either operation more than once on the same index."

      "content": "When applying the operations, remember that you can apply both operations to the same index, but only once each. This means you need to prioritize which operation to apply first based on the potential reduction in value."
