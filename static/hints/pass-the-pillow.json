      "content": "Consider how the pillow's position changes over time. For the first n seconds, the pillow will simply move to the next person in line. After reaching person n, it will start moving back to person 1."

      "content": "If the effective time is less than n, the position can be directly calculated as `position = effective_time + 1` since it starts from person 1. For example, if effective_time is 3, the pillow is with person 4."

      "content": "If the effective time is greater than or equal to n, you need to calculate how far back the pillow has moved. The formula for the backward movement is `position = n - (effective_time - n)`, which accounts for the reverse direction."
