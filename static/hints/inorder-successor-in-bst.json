      "content": "First, understand what an inorder successor is in the context of a Binary Search Tree (BST). The inorder successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the given node."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that in a BST, the left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree only nodes with keys greater. This property is crucial for finding the inorder successor."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the two main cases for finding the inorder successor: 1) If the node has a right child, the successor is the leftmost node in that right subtree. 2) If the node does not have a right child, you need to traverse up the tree until you find a node that is a left child of its parent."
    },
    {
      "content": "When traversing up the tree, keep track of the parent nodes. This is important because you might need to return to the root or a higher ancestor if the node does not have a right child."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. What happens if the node is the largest node in the BST? In this case, there would be no inorder successor. How will you handle this situation in your code?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where the input node is null. The function should return null or an appropriate value when the input is invalid."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the return type of your function. It should return the inorder successor node, not just its value. Ensure your function signature reflects this."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, you might want to use a helper function to find the leftmost node in a subtree, as this will be a common operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the solution, remember to test with various BST structures, especially edge cases like a single-node tree or a tree where the node is the maximum value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, consider how you will structure your code to handle both cases (with and without a right child) efficiently. You may want to outline your logic before coding."
