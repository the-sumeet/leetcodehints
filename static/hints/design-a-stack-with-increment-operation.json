      "content": "Start by thinking about how a standard stack works. You will need to implement basic stack operations: push, pop, and keep track of the elements in the stack."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to maintain the maximum size of the stack. You can use a simple condition to check if the stack has reached its maxSize before allowing a push operation."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the `pop` method, remember to handle the case where the stack is empty. In this case, you should return -1 as specified."

    {
      "content": "The `increment` operation requires you to modify the bottom k elements of the stack. Think about how you can efficiently access these elements based on the current size of the stack."

      "content": "If k is greater than the current size of the stack, you will need to increment all elements in the stack. Be sure to handle this edge case properly."

      "content": "When incrementing elements, consider how to store the increment values. You might want to maintain an auxiliary array to track the increments for each element."

    {
      "content": "After incrementing the bottom k elements, ensure that you correctly apply these increments when popping elements from the stack. This will require careful management of the increment values."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to optimize the `increment` operation. Instead of incrementing the values immediately, you could delay the increment until the values are popped."

      "content": "Make sure to test your implementation with edge cases, such as trying to pop from an empty stack or incrementing more elements than exist in the stack."

      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your methods adhere to the constraints provided in the problem statement. For example, check that all values for push and increment are within the specified limits."
