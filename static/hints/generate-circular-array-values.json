      "content": "Consider how you can access elements using modulo operations. If you have an index `i` and an array of size `n`, you can access the circular index with `i % n`. This will help you wrap around the array."

      "content": "Think about how to handle negative indices. If you are given a negative index, you might want to convert it to a positive equivalent in the context of the circular array. For instance, an index of -1 in an array of size 5 would correspond to index 4."

      "content": "When retrieving values from the circular array, ensure you apply the modulo operation to both positive and negative indices correctly. For example, if the index is `-3` and the array size is `5`, the corresponding circular index would be `(5 + (-3) % 5) % 5`."
