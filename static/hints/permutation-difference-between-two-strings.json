      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to calculate the permutation difference between two strings, `s` and `t`. Remember, `t` is a permutation of `s`, meaning it contains the same characters but in a different order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can find the index of each character in both strings. You can use a loop to iterate through the characters of `s` and `t` and store their indices in a dictionary or an array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to calculate the absolute difference between the indices of each character in `s` and `t`. The absolute difference can be calculated using the formula `|index_in_s - index_in_t|`."
    },
    {
      "content": "You will need to sum up these absolute differences for all characters in the strings. Make sure to iterate through each character in `s`, as it is the reference for comparison."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the strings `s` and `t` have unique characters. This means you won't have to deal with duplicate characters when calculating the differences."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as the smallest possible strings, like `s = 'a'` and `t = 'a'`. What would the permutation difference be in this case? Think about how your function should handle such cases."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can optimize your approach by creating a mapping of characters to their indices for both strings before calculating the differences. This will make it easier to access indices quickly."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure that you are correctly handling the indexing. Both strings are 0-indexed, so be mindful of how you access the characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the indices for both strings, use a loop to iterate through the characters of `s`, compute the absolute differences, and maintain a running total of these differences."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, return the total sum of the differences. Make sure to test your function with various inputs, including edge cases and longer strings, to ensure its correctness."
