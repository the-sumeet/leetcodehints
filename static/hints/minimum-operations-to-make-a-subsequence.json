      "content": "Start by understanding the definition of a subsequence. A subsequence can be formed by deleting some elements from an array without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, from [1, 2, 3], you can form [1, 3] or [2] but not [3, 1]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the relationship between the two arrays, `target` and `arr`. You need to ensure that all elements of `target` appear in `arr` in the same order. This means that the elements of `target` must be present in `arr` to form a valid subsequence."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can track the positions of elements in `arr` that match those in `target`. You might want to create a mapping from the elements of `target` to their indices in `arr` to facilitate this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that `target` contains distinct integers, while `arr` can have duplicates. This means you only need to worry about the presence of each unique element in `target` when checking if it can be a subsequence."
    },
    {
      "content": "A useful approach is to iterate through `target` and check if each element can be found in `arr`. You can maintain a pointer to track your position in `arr` as you search for elements of `target`."

      "content": "If an element from `target` is not found in the remaining part of `arr`, you will need to perform an operation to insert it. Count how many such insertions are necessary."

      "content": "Consider using a two-pointer technique: one pointer for `target` and another for `arr`. This can help you efficiently find matches while keeping track of how many elements you need to insert."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `arr` is empty or when `target` has elements that are not present in `arr` at all. How would these scenarios affect the number of operations needed?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to preprocess `arr` to create a list of indices for each element. This way, when you look for an element from `target`, you can quickly find where it appears in `arr`."

    {
      "content": "If you find that an element from `target` is present in `arr`, update your pointer in `arr` to the next position after the found element. This will help you maintain the order required for subsequences."
