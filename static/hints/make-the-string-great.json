      "content": "Consider how you can identify bad pairs in the string. You can iterate through the string and check each character against the next one to see if they form a bad pair."

      "content": "Think about how you can remove characters from the string. When you find a bad pair, you can remove both characters. However, after removing them, you should check again if new bad pairs are formed."

      "content": "Using a loop to repeatedly remove bad pairs can lead to complications. Instead, consider using a data structure that allows you to build the resulting string efficiently, like a stack."
