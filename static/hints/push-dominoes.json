      "content": "Consider how the dominoes falling to the left ('L') and right ('R') affect the adjacent dominoes. For example, if you have 'R.' followed by 'L', what happens to the '.'? This is a key interaction to analyze."

      "content": "Identify the segments of dominoes that are affected by a push. For example, in the string '.L.R...', the domino at position 1 is influenced by the 'L' and the one at position 3 by the 'R'. How do you determine which dominoes will fall and which will remain standing?"

      "content": "Think about how to traverse the string. You might want to use a loop to go through each character and check its state. Keep track of the last seen 'R' or 'L' to determine how the '.' characters should change."

      "content": "When you encounter a 'R', mark the position and continue until you find an 'L' or reach the end of the string. If you find an 'L' before a '.', consider the distance between 'R' and 'L' to decide how the '.' should be updated."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where dominoes are at the ends of the string. For example, if the string starts with 'R', all subsequent '.' should become 'R'. Similarly, if it ends with 'L', all preceding '.' should become 'L'."
