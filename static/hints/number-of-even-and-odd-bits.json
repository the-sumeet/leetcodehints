    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that in binary representation, the rightmost bit is considered index 0. This means that when counting indices, you should start from 0 for the least significant bit."

    {
      "content": "Identify how to differentiate between even and odd indices. An even index is one where the index number is divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4), while an odd index is one where the index number is not (e.g., 1, 3, 5)."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you traverse the binary representation, keep track of the index of each bit. You can use a loop to iterate through the binary string from right to left, checking each bit."

      "content": "For each bit that is '1', check its index. If the index is even, increment your even count; if odd, increment your odd count. This will help you build your result array."

      "content": "Make sure to initialize your counts for even and odd bits to zero before you start counting. This will ensure you do not carry over counts from previous calculations."

      "content": "When implementing the loop, remember to stop when you have processed all bits in the binary representation. You can use the length of the binary string to guide you."
