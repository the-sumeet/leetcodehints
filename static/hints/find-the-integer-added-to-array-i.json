      "content": "Start by understanding the relationship between the two arrays. Each element in `nums1` has been modified by adding the same integer `x` to produce `nums2`. This means that for each corresponding element, you can express this as: `nums2[i] = nums1[i] + x`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can isolate `x`. Rearranging the equation gives you `x = nums2[i] - nums1[i]`. This means you can calculate `x` for each pair of corresponding elements in the two arrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since `nums1` and `nums2` are guaranteed to be of equal length, you can iterate through the arrays using a loop. Think about how you would store the value of `x` calculated from the first pair of elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you loop through the arrays, you will notice that `x` should be the same for all pairs. Consider how you can check if the calculated `x` from each pair is consistent across the entire array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. The values in both arrays are non-negative and can go up to 1000, and their lengths are between 1 and 100. How does this affect your approach?"

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. For example, what happens when both arrays contain the same elements? In this case, what should `x` be? How will your logic handle this scenario?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to use a variable to keep track of the value of `x` as you iterate through the arrays. If you find a mismatch in the calculated `x`, what should you do?"

    {
      "content": "Consider initializing `x` with the value from the first pair of elements. Then, as you iterate, compare the calculated `x` from subsequent pairs to this initial value. What will you do if they differ?"

    {
      "content": "Once you have confirmed that the calculated `x` is consistent across all pairs, you can return this value. Make sure your function handles the return correctly."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution is efficient. Since you are iterating through the arrays only once, your solution should run in O(n) time complexity, which is optimal given the constraints."
