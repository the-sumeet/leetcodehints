      "content": "Start by understanding the definition of an alternating array. For an array to be alternating, every element at an even index must match the elements two indices before it, and every element at an odd index must be different from its neighbors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the structure of the array. You can think of the array as two separate groups: one for even indices and one for odd indices. Each group must follow the alternating rules independently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Count the frequency of each number in both the even and odd indexed positions. This will help you determine which numbers are most common in these positions, as you will want to minimize changes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the frequency counts, identify the most frequent number in the even indexed group and the most frequent number in the odd indexed group. These will be your candidates for minimizing the number of changes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be careful with the case where the most frequent numbers in both groups are the same. In this scenario, you will need to consider the second most frequent number in one of the groups to avoid conflicts."

    {
      "content": "Calculate the number of changes needed for both scenarios: keeping the most frequent number in both groups, and switching to the second most frequent number in one of the groups if necessary."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the total number of changes is the sum of the changes needed for the even indexed group and the odd indexed group. Make sure to account for all indices correctly."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the array length is very small (like 1 or 2). How would you handle these cases? They may not require any changes at all."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, think about the time complexity. You want to ensure that your approach runs efficiently, especially since the maximum length of the array can be up to 100,000."

    {
      "content": "Finally, outline your approach in pseudocode. For example, you might start with counting frequencies, then determining the most common elements, and finally calculating the required operations based on those frequencies."
