      "content": "For the starting point (0,0), the minimum path sum is simply the value at that cell. What should you do for the first row and the first column since they can only be reached from one direction?"

      "content": "When calculating the minimum path sum for a cell, you might use a formula like: `grid[i][j] += min(grid[i-1][j], grid[i][j-1])`. Ensure that you handle edge cases for the first row and first column."
