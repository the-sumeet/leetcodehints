      "content": "Think about what it means for a number to have unique digits. For example, the number 123 has unique digits, while 122 does not. This property will be crucial for your counting logic."

      "content": "Consider the maximum possible digits in the numbers you are counting. For instance, if the input is 20, you only need to consider numbers with at most two digits."

      "content": "Break down the problem by counting unique digit numbers based on the number of digits. For example, count all unique digit numbers with 1 digit, then with 2 digits, and so on."

      "content": "To count unique digit numbers with 'd' digits, use permutations. For example, for a 2-digit number, the first digit can be chosen from 1-9 (9 options), and the second from the remaining digits (10 - d options)."
