      "content": "Think about how you can calculate the product of elements in a subarray. You might want to use a nested loop to generate all possible subarrays and calculate their products, but consider the efficiency of this approach."

      "content": "Notice that the problem asks for the product to be strictly less than k. What happens when k is less than or equal to 1? How would that affect the possible subarrays?"

      "content": "Instead of using a nested loop to generate subarrays, consider using a sliding window technique. This allows you to maintain a window of elements and adjust its size dynamically based on the product."

      "content": "As you implement the sliding window, keep track of the current product of the elements in the window. If the product exceeds or equals k, you will need to shrink the window from the left."
