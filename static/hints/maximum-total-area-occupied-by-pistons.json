    {
      "content": "Consider how the directions affect the pistons' heights. Each 'U' increases the height of a piston by 1, while each 'D' decreases it by 1. Think about how you can track the heights as you process the direction string."

      "content": "Remember that the area occupied by pistons can be calculated as the sum of the heights. After processing all directions, you will need to sum the heights of the pistons to get the total area."

      "content": "As you iterate through the directions, keep track of which piston to update. If the direction string is longer than the number of pistons, how will you handle that? Will you wrap around or stop?"

      "content": "When updating the heights, ensure you are modifying the correct piston based on the current index. You might want to use modulo operation to cycle through piston indices if needed."

    "Input consists of an integer for the number of pistons, an array of heights, and a string of directions.",
    "Each direction affects the corresponding piston height sequentially.",
    "Negative heights should be handled appropriately (e.g., set to zero).",
    "Consider performance implications based on the size of the input.",
    "Return type should match the expected format, typically an integer for the total area."
