      "content": "Start by understanding what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], the subarrays include [1], [2], [3], [1, 2], [2, 3], and [1, 2, 3]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, think about how to calculate the number of distinct elements in a subarray. You can use a set to keep track of unique elements as you iterate through the subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can generate all possible subarrays from the given array. You can use two nested loops: the outer loop for the starting index and the inner loop for the ending index."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you have a subarray defined by indices i and j, you can use a set to count distinct elements. For example, for the subarray nums[i..j], initialize an empty set and add each element from nums[i] to nums[j]."

    {
      "content": "Remember to collect the counts of distinct elements for each subarray. You can store these counts in a list or array as you process each subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "After generating the counts of distinct elements for all subarrays, sort this list to create the uniqueness array. Sorting is crucial for finding the median later."
    },
    {
      "content": "The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted. If the length of the array is odd, the median is the middle element. If it is even, the median is the smaller of the two middle elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. The input array can have a maximum length of 100,000, which means your solution needs to be efficient to handle large inputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the input array has only one element. The uniqueness array in this case will simply be [1], and the median will also be 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can optimize the counting of distinct elements in a subarray. Instead of recalculating for every subarray, you might use a sliding window approach or a hash map to track counts."

    {
      "content": "As you build the uniqueness array, ensure that you only keep distinct counts. You can use a set to filter out duplicates before sorting."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the sorted uniqueness array, calculate the median based on whether its length is odd or even. Use the appropriate indexing to retrieve the median value."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the solution, consider the time complexity of your approach. Generating all subarrays and counting distinct elements can lead to a high time complexity if not handled efficiently."

      "content": "To summarize, your approach will involve generating subarrays, counting distinct elements, storing these counts, sorting the counts, and finally calculating the median."
