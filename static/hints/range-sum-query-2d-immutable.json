    {
      "content": "Consider the naive solution where you iterate through the specified rectangle for each query. This would take O((row2-row1+1)*(col2-col1+1)) time for each query. How can you improve this time complexity?"

      "content": "A common approach is to use a prefix sum array. This array will allow you to store cumulative sums, which can be used to compute the sum of any sub-rectangle efficiently. How would you define this prefix sum array for a 2D matrix?"

    {
      "content": "When creating the prefix sum array, remember that each entry at (i, j) in this array should represent the sum of all elements from the top-left corner (0, 0) to (i, j). Can you write the formula to compute this?"

      "content": "To retrieve the sum of the rectangle, you will need to use an inclusion-exclusion principle. Specifically, you will add and subtract certain prefix sums based on the corners of the rectangle. Can you outline the steps for this calculation?"
