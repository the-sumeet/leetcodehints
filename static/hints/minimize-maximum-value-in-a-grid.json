    {
      "content": "Think about what operations you are allowed to perform on the grid. Are you allowed to change the values directly, or are there specific rules for how you can adjust them? Clarifying this will guide your approach."

      "content": "Consider the concept of 'maximum value' in the context of the grid. What does it mean to minimize the maximum value? You may need to identify the current maximum value in the grid as a starting point."

      "content": "Identify the lower and upper bounds for your binary search. The lower bound could be the minimum value in the grid, while the upper bound could be the maximum value. How do these bounds help in your search?"

      "content": "When performing binary search, you'll need a way to check if a certain maximum value is achievable. Think about how you can validate if you can adjust the grid values to ensure no value exceeds this maximum."
