    {
      "content": "When you encounter a lowercase letter, you should append it to a result string. Think about how you can maintain this result as you process the string from left to right."

      "content": "The '*' character is used to remove the last character from the result. Consider how you can implement this removal efficiently, especially if the result is empty."

      "content": "The '%' character reverses the current result. You might want to explore how to reverse a string in your programming language of choice. Keep in mind that reversing an empty string should still result in an empty string."

      "content": "Remember that the index `k` is zero-based. This means that if `k` is equal to the length of the result, it is out of bounds, and you should return '.' in that case."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the result becomes empty due to operations like '*' or when `k` is very large. You need to ensure your solution can handle these without errors."
