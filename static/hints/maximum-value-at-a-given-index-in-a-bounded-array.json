    {
      "content": "Consider the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1`. This implies that the values in the array can only differ by at most 1 from their neighbors. Think about how this affects the possible values for `nums[index]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "To maximize `nums[index]`, you need to consider how the values to the left and right of `index` will influence the total sum. If `nums[index]` is `x`, then `nums[index-1]` can be `x-1` or `x`, and `nums[index+1]` can be `x-1` or `x`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to distribute the remaining sum after deciding on `nums[index]`. The total sum of the array must not exceed `maxSum`, so you will need to account for the contributions from both sides of `index`."

      "content": "You can calculate the maximum possible value for `nums[index]` using a binary search approach. The lower bound can start at 1, and the upper bound can be `maxSum`."

    {
      "content": "When performing binary search, for a given mid value (potential value for `nums[index]`), calculate if it's feasible to construct the array without exceeding `maxSum`. This involves calculating the required sum for both sides of `index`."
    },
    {
      "content": "To calculate the required sum for the left side (from `index` to 0), consider how many numbers you can fill and how high they can go. Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to help with this calculation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Similarly, calculate the required sum for the right side (from `index` to `n-1`). Make sure to handle the cases where the number of elements on either side is less than the height of `nums[index]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to check edge cases, such as when `index` is at the start (0) or the end (`n-1`) of the array. These cases might simplify your calculations since one side will have fewer elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your binary search correctly narrows down to the maximum valid value for `nums[index]`. If a mid value is valid, try a higher value; if it's not, lower the search space."
