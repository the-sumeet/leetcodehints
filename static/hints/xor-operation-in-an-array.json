    {
      "content": "Consider how many elements will be in the array. The length of the array `nums` is equal to `n`, which is provided as input. Make sure you account for this when iterating through the array."

    {
      "content": "Think about the properties of the XOR operation. Remember that `a ^ a = 0` and `a ^ 0 = a`. This means that if you XOR the same number an even number of times, it will cancel out."

      "content": "You can initialize a variable to hold the result of the XOR operation. Start with a value of 0, since XORing with 0 does not change the result."

      "content": "Remember that the XOR operation is both associative and commutative. This means the order in which you apply the XOR does not matter, which can simplify your implementation."
