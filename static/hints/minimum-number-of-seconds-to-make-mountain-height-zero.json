      "content": "Consider how the work is distributed among the workers. Since they work simultaneously, the total time to reduce the mountain height will be determined by the worker who takes the longest time. Think about how you can represent this using a max function."

    {
      "content": "For a single worker, the time to reduce the mountain height can be calculated directly using a formula. For example, if a worker has a time of t and reduces the height by h, the total time is t * (1 + 2 + ... + h). Can you simplify this?"

    {
      "content": "When multiple workers are involved, you need to consider all possible distributions of the mountain height reduction. A good approach might be to use a loop to simulate the height reduction for each worker and calculate the time taken."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure that you are correctly calculating the time for each worker based on the height they are reducing. Pay close attention to how you accumulate the time for each worker's tasks."
