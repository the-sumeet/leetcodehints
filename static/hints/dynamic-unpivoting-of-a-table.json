      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input data. You have a table with product IDs and their corresponding values across different stores. Each row represents a product, and each column represents a store."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will transform the table. The goal is to 'unpivot' the data, meaning you will convert the wide format into a long format. Think about how you can represent each product's store values as separate rows."

    {
      "content": "Identify the key components of the transformation. You will need to iterate over each row of the table and then for each store, create a new row with the product ID and the store value."

      "content": "Pay attention to null values in the data. When you unpivot, you may want to decide how to handle these nulls. Will you include them in your output, or will you filter them out?"

    {
      "content": "Think about the output format. You will likely need a list of dictionaries or a similar structure that clearly represents each product's ID alongside the store name and its value."
