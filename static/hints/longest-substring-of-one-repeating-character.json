      "content": "For each query, after updating the character at the specified index, you might want to check both sides of the updated character to see if it connects with any repeating characters."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the updated character is the same as the character it replaces. In this case, the longest substring might not change."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where the entire string consists of the same character. This should give you the length of the string as the longest substring."

      "content": "You might want to implement a helper function to calculate the longest substring of repeating characters, which can be called after each query."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep testing with different edge cases, such as updates that do not change the string or updates that create a new longest substring."
