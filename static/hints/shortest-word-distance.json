      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find the shortest distance between two given words in a list of words. Make sure to clarify what 'distance' means in this context."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will represent the words in the list. You might want to iterate through the list and keep track of the indices of the two words you are comparing. Think about how you will store these indices."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating through the list, check if the current word matches either of the two target words. If it does, record its index. You may want to use two variables to track the most recent indices of the two words."

    {
      "content": "As you find indices of the two words, calculate the distance between them. The distance can be calculated as the absolute difference between the two indices. Keep track of the minimum distance found so far."

      "content": "Remember to handle cases where one or both of the words do not exist in the list. What should you return in such cases? Consider returning a specific value or throwing an exception."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when the two words are the same. In this case, you will need to find the closest occurrences of that word in the list."

      "content": "You should also consider the time complexity of your approach. A simple linear scan through the list is O(n), but think about how you can optimize if you need to handle very large lists."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure that you update the minimum distance each time you find a new pair of indices. This will help you keep track of the shortest distance efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct minimum distance after you have finished iterating through the list. Remember to test your function with various inputs to validate its correctness."
