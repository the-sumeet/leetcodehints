      "content": "Consider how you can split the array into k subarrays. Each subarray must be non-empty, so think about how to iterate through the array while maintaining this constraint."

      "content": "Think about the maximum XOR value among the k subarrays. Your goal is to minimize this maximum value. What happens if you try different partitions? Can you find a way to evaluate the maximum XOR for a given partition?"

      "content": "Dynamic programming could be a useful approach here. You might want to define a DP state that keeps track of the minimum possible maximum XOR for the first 'i' elements divided into 'j' subarrays."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when k is equal to the length of the array. In this case, each element would be its own subarray, and the maximum XOR would simply be the maximum element in the array."
