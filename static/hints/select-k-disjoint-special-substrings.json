      "content": "Consider how to identify characters that are unique to certain substrings. You might want to create a frequency map of characters to see where they appear in the string. This will help you determine which characters can form special substrings."

      "content": "Take into account the condition that the special substring cannot be the entire string. This means your substrings must be at least one character long, but less than the length of the string."
