    {
      "content": "Consider the base cases. What happens when you have only one post or one color? Think about how these simple cases can help you build your solution."

      "content": "For two posts, if you have two colors, how many ways can you paint them? Can you outline the possible combinations?"

      "content": "Think about the recursive nature of the problem. If you know how to paint 'n-1' posts, how can you use that to find the number of ways to paint 'n' posts?"

      "content": "Identify the relationship between the number of ways to paint the fence with 'n' posts and 'n-1' posts. You might want to define a function that captures this relationship."

      "content": "Think about using dynamic programming to store results of subproblems. This can help avoid recalculating the number of ways to paint smaller sections of the fence."

      "content": "Remember to account for the constraints of the problem, especially the maximum values for the number of posts and colors. This will affect the efficiency of your solution."

    {
      "content": "Finally, consider how to implement the final calculation based on your recursive or dynamic programming approach. You should be close to formulating the final function that returns the total number of ways to paint the fence."

    "Constraints: Ensure to check the limits for the number of posts and colors.",
    "Indexing: Posts are typically indexed starting from 1.",
    "Uniqueness: Adjacent posts cannot have the same color.",
    "Return format: Ensure your final output is the total number of valid ways to paint the fence."
