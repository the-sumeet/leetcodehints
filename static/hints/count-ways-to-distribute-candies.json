      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to count the distinct ways to distribute a given number of candies among a certain number of children. Think about how the distribution can vary based on the number of candies and children."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the base cases. For example, if you have 0 candies, how many ways can you distribute them among any number of children? What if you have 0 children? This can help clarify your thought process."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the problem mathematically. You might want to use combinatorial mathematics, particularly the concept of combinations or partitions, to express the distribution of candies."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using dynamic programming to solve the problem. You can create a table where each entry represents the number of ways to distribute a certain number of candies to a certain number of children."
    },
    {
      "content": "Define your state clearly. For example, let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to distribute `i` candies to `j` children. How would you initialize this table?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the transitions in your dynamic programming approach. If you want to distribute `i` candies to `j` children, how can you relate this to smaller subproblems like distributing `i-1` candies or `i-j` candies?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when the number of candies is less than the number of children. What should the output be in such scenarios? How does this affect your DP table initialization?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the order of distribution does not matter. This means that if you give one candy to one child and another candy to the same child, it should be considered the same distribution as giving those two candies to different children."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints of the problem. Are there limits on the number of candies or children? How might these constraints affect your approach or the efficiency of your solution?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a recursive approach with memoization as an alternative to dynamic programming. How would you define your recursive function to count the ways to distribute candies?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Explore the possibility of using combinatorial formulas directly. For instance, how might you apply the 'stars and bars' theorem to solve this problem?"

    {
      "content": "Make sure to account for large numbers in your calculations. You may need to use modular arithmetic to ensure that your results fit within standard data types."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you build your solution, test it against edge cases and small inputs first. This will help you ensure that your logic holds before scaling up to larger numbers."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about the return format. Are you expected to return the count as an integer, or is there a specific format that you need to adhere to? Make sure to clarify this before finalizing your solution."

    "The number of candies and the number of children are both non-negative integers.",
