    {
      "content": "Consider the frequency of characters in `word2`. You'll need to count how many of each character are required to form `word2`. This can be done using a frequency array or a dictionary."

      "content": "Remember that the length of valid substrings must be at least the length of `word2`. You can start checking substrings of `word1` that have a length equal to or greater than `word2`."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution is optimized for the constraints given. You will need to handle up to 100,000 characters in `word1` and 10,000 characters in `word2`, so aim for a linear time complexity solution."
