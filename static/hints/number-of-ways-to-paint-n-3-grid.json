      "content": "For n = 1, you can paint the first cell in 3 ways. The second cell can be painted in 2 ways (it can't be the same as the first), and the third cell can also be painted in 2 ways. Calculate this to confirm your understanding."

    {
      "content": "Now, think about how to extend this to n = 2. You'll have to consider the previous row's colors when painting the next row. How does the choice of colors in the first row affect the second?"
