      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to maximize a number composed only of the digits 6 and 9 by changing at most one digit. Think about how changing a digit affects the overall value of the number."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the structure of the number. Since you can only change one digit, identify the most significant digit where a change would yield the highest increase in value. Remember, changing a 6 to a 9 will always increase the number."
    },
    {
      "content": "What happens if you encounter a 9? Since changing a 9 to a 6 will decrease the number, you should focus on changing only 6s. Think about how you can iterate through the digits of the number to find the first 6."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you find a 6, consider changing it to a 9. After making this change, you should stop further changes, as you are allowed to change at most one digit. This is crucial for maximizing the number."
    },
    {
      "content": "If the number consists only of 9s, changing any digit would not yield a higher number. Think about how you can handle this case efficiently without unnecessary operations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will represent the number. Since it can be large, think about using a string representation to easily access and modify individual digits."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep in mind the constraints: the number is always a positive integer and consists only of 6s and 9s. This simplifies your checks when iterating through the digits."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating through the digits, remember to convert the string back to an integer after making your change to ensure you are returning the correct format."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as the smallest possible number (6) or a number that is already at its maximum (9999). How will your solution handle these?"
    },
    {
      "content": "You are very close to a solution! To implement your logic, you can use a loop to find the first occurrence of 6, change it to 9, and then return the resulting number. Make sure to convert it back to an integer before returning."
