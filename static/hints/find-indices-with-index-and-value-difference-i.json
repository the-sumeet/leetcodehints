      "content": "Consider the constraints provided: the length of the array is between 1 and 100, and the values range from 0 to 50. This means you can afford to use a nested loop approach since the maximum operations would be manageable."

      "content": "Remember that you can select the same index for both `i` and `j`. This means you should check if `abs(i - j) >= indexDifference` can be satisfied when `i = j`."
