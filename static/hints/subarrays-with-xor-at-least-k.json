    {
      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the XOR operation. XOR of two bits is 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. For example, 3 XOR 1 = 2 because in binary, 3 is 11 and 1 is 01."

      "content": "Consider how to compute the XOR of elements in a subarray. You can maintain a running XOR as you iterate through the array. For a subarray starting at index i and ending at index j, XOR can be computed incrementally."
