      "content": "Start by understanding what function composition means. When you have multiple functions, you apply them one after the other, starting from the last function in the list. For example, if you have functions f, g, and h, the composition is f(g(h(x)))."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would handle an empty array of functions. The problem states that the composition of zero functions should return the identity function, which means it should return the input value unchanged."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the composition of functions in your code. You might want to use a loop or a method that allows you to apply each function to the result of the previous one."

      "content": "Remember that functions in JavaScript can be treated as first-class citizens. You can pass them around just like any other variable. This means you can create a new function that incorporates the logic of all the functions in the array."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the array of functions, remember to start from the last function and move to the first. This is crucial because function composition is applied from the innermost function to the outermost."

    {
      "content": "Consider using the `reduce` method to help with the composition. `reduce` can take an accumulator and apply each function in the array to it, allowing you to build the composed function step by step."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where the input array is empty. You can check the length of the array at the beginning of your function and return the identity function if it's zero."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you compose the functions, think about how you will structure the final function. You will want to create a function that takes an integer input and applies all the composed functions to it."
    },
    {
      "content": "When composing the functions, remember that the output of one function becomes the input for the next. Keep track of this flow as you build your composed function."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your final function can be called with an integer input and returns the expected output after applying all the functions in the correct order. You are almost there!"
