      "content": "Start by understanding what a shortest common supersequence (SCS) is. An SCS of a set of strings is the shortest string that contains each of the strings as a subsequence."

      "content": "Remember that each string in the input array has a fixed length of 2. This can simplify your approach since you only need to consider pairs of characters."

      "content": "Consider how to combine the characters of the strings. For example, if you have 'ab' and 'ba', think about how you can interleave these characters to form different combinations."

      "content": "When generating SCSs, keep in mind that the order of characters matters. The resulting string must maintain the order of characters from each original string."

    {
      "content": "Focus on generating unique SCSs. If two SCSs are permutations of each other, you should only keep one of them in your final output."

      "content": "You can use a frequency array of size 26 to represent the count of each character in the resulting SCS. This will help you easily compare different SCSs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where all input strings are the same. In this case, the SCS will just be the characters of the string repeated according to their counts."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the input strings have overlapping characters. This will affect how you construct the SCS and ensure all strings are represented."

      "content": "When counting character frequencies, remember to initialize your frequency array to zero for all characters before updating it based on the SCS."
    },

      "content": "Make sure to handle the output format correctly. You need to return a 2D array of frequency counts, where each inner array corresponds to a unique SCS."
