      "content": "Consider how to represent numbers with all set bits mathematically. A number with all set bits can be expressed as 2^k - 1, where k is the number of bits. For example, for k=3, 2^3 - 1 = 7."

      "content": "You can start checking from n and incrementally test each number to see if it has all bits set. A number has all bits set if it is of the form 2^k - 1 for some k."

    {
      "content": "To check if a number has all bits set, you can use a bit manipulation trick: `x & (x + 1)` should equal 0. This works because if all bits are set, adding 1 will cause a carry that resets all bits."
