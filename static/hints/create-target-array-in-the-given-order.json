      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the `nums` and `index` arrays. Each element in `nums` corresponds to an insertion point in the `target` array defined by the same index in `index`. This means the first element in `nums` will be inserted at the position specified by the first element in `index`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the `target` array starts empty. As you process each element from `nums`, you will be modifying the `target` array by inserting elements at specified positions. Think about how you can dynamically manage the size of the `target` array as you insert new elements."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle the insertion operation. In many programming languages, inserting an element at a specific index can shift other elements. Make sure you are comfortable with how your chosen language handles array or list operations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Take a closer look at the constraints given in the problem. Note that `0 <= index[i] <= i` ensures that you will always be inserting within the bounds of the `target` array. This guarantees that you won't encounter an out-of-bounds error during insertion."

      "content": "You might want to visualize the process with a small example. For instance, with `nums = [0, 1]` and `index = [0, 0]`, how does the `target` array evolve? This can help clarify how the insertion works step-by-step."

    {
      "content": "As you build the `target` array, remember that the elements already in the array will shift to accommodate new elements. Keep track of how the array looks after each insertion to ensure you understand the final structure."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you might implement this in code. You could use a loop to iterate through the `nums` and `index` arrays. For each iteration, you will need to insert the current `nums[i]` into the `target` array at the position `index[i]`."

    {
      "content": "When inserting elements, consider using a method or function that allows you to insert at a specific index. For example, in Python, you can use the `insert` method of a list. In other languages, look for similar functionality."

      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, consider edge cases. What if `nums` and `index` contain only one element? Or if they are at their maximum length? Ensure your solution handles these scenarios correctly."

      "content": "Now, try to outline your code structure. You will need a loop that goes through the length of `nums`, and within that loop, perform the insertion operation. This is the final step before writing the actual code."
