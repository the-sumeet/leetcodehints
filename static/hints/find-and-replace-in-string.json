    {
      "content": "Remember that the replacement operations must be performed simultaneously. This means that if you replace a substring at one index, it should not affect the indices of other replacements. Think about how you can store the results of replacements before applying them."

    {
      "content": "Before performing a replacement, you need to check if the substring `sources[i]` actually exists in `s` starting at `indices[i]`. Use string slicing to verify this condition. For example, `s[indices[i]:indices[i] + len(sources[i])]` should equal `sources[i]`."

      "content": "Consider using a list to build your final result. Strings in Python are immutable, so modifying them directly can be inefficient. You can construct a list of characters and join them at the end to form the final string."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the lengths of the `sources` and `targets`. Ensure that when you check for a match, you do not go out of bounds of the string `s`. This can happen if `indices[i] + len(sources[i])` exceeds the length of `s`."

    {
      "content": "It's essential to handle cases where a `source` does not match. In such cases, just skip that replacement. You can use a simple `if` statement to check for a match before proceeding with the replacement."

    {
      "content": "To manage the replacements, you can create a list initialized with the original string's characters. When a replacement is valid, update the corresponding indices in this list with the `target` string."

      "content": "After processing all replacements, remember to join the list back into a string. Use the `''.join(list)` method to convert your list of characters back to a single string."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about the overall time complexity of your solution. You will need to iterate through the `k` replacements, and for each, you may need to check a substring, which could lead to a time complexity of O(k * m) where m is the average length of the source strings."
