      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement thoroughly. You need to distribute a certain number of candies to children in such a way that the distribution meets specific conditions. What are the constraints on how many candies each child can receive?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would represent the number of candies and children. You might want to use an array or a list to keep track of how many candies each child receives."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the total number of candies you have and how many children you need to distribute them to. What happens if the number of candies is less than the number of children?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Check if there are any constraints on how many candies each child can receive. For example, can a child receive zero candies? What about negative candies?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the distribution rules. Are there any specific patterns or sequences in how candies should be distributed? For example, should each child receive at least one candy?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the number of candies is exactly equal to the number of children. How would you handle this situation?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you will iterate through the children to distribute the candies. You might want to use a loop that continues until all candies are distributed."
    },
    {
      "content": "What if you run out of candies before all children have received their share? How will you handle the remaining children?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach to distribute candies. For instance, you could give each child one candy at a time until you run out."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may need to implement a way to track how many candies each child has received. This could be a simple array where the index represents the child."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you will handle cases where multiple children might receive the same number of candies. Is there a need for tie-breaking?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will return the final distribution of candies. Should you return an array, and if so, what should it represent?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to validate your inputs. For example, what should happen if the number of candies or children is negative?"
    },
    {
      "content": "As you approach the solution, think about how to optimize your algorithm. Could you reduce the time complexity of your solution?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, test it against various edge cases, such as having more candies than children, fewer candies than children, and equal amounts."

    "Constraints: Ensure the number of candies and children are non-negative.",
    "Indexing: Children are typically indexed from 0 to n-1.",
    "Uniqueness: Each child may receive a unique number of candies based on the distribution rules.",
    "Tie-breaking: Define how to handle situations where multiple children receive the same number of candies.",
    "Return format: Decide on the format of the output, typically an array representing the distribution."
