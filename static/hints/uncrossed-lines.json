      "content": "Consider using a dynamic programming approach. You can create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of uncrossed lines that can be drawn using the first `i` elements of `nums1` and the first `j` elements of `nums2`."

      "content": "Identify the base case for your dynamic programming array. If either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, then the maximum number of lines is 0. This will help you initialize your `dp` array."

      "content": "As you fill in the `dp` array, think about the conditions under which you can draw a line. If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, you can draw a line and increase the count based on previous values in the `dp` array."

      "content": "When `nums1[i-1] != nums2[j-1]`, you should consider the maximum lines possible by either ignoring the current element of `nums1` or `nums2`. This will help you decide how to fill in the `dp` array."
