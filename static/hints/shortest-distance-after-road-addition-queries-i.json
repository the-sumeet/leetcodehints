    {
      "content": "When a new road is added from city `u_i` to city `v_i`, think about how this could potentially shorten the path from `0` to `n-1`. Consider how you might represent the roads and cities."

      "content": "You can represent the cities and roads as a directed graph. Each city can be a node, and each road can be a directed edge. This will help you visualize how the roads connect the cities."

    {
      "content": "After each query, you need to calculate the shortest path from city `0` to city `n-1`. You might want to consider using a breadth-first search (BFS) or Dijkstra's algorithm for this task, especially since the roads are unidirectional."

    {
      "content": "Remember to update your graph after each query. Each time you add a new road, you need to ensure that the graph reflects this addition before calculating the shortest path."

    {
      "content": "Take note of the constraints: `1 < queries[i][1] - queries[i][0]` ensures that there is always a gap between `u_i` and `v_i`. This means that adding a road does not create a direct cycle in the graph."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep track of the shortest distance dynamically. Instead of recalculating the entire path from scratch after each query, see if you can update the shortest path incrementally."

      "content": "Finally, consider how to handle cases where the new road does not affect the shortest path. In such cases, the shortest distance remains the same as before the query."
