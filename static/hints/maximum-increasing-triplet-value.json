    {
      "content": "Consider how you might iterate through the list to find potential triplets. You could use nested loops to check every combination of three indices, but think about the time complexity of this approach."

      "content": "What if you could reduce the number of comparisons? Think about how you can keep track of the smallest values as you iterate through the list. This might help you identify valid triplets more efficiently."

      "content": "As you look for increasing triplets, remember that the order of indices matters. If you find a valid triplet, how will you ensure that you're checking all possible combinations without repeating any indices?"

      "content": "Consider edge cases. What happens if the input list has fewer than three elements? Make sure your solution handles this gracefully by returning an appropriate value."

      "content": "Keep in mind that the problem requires you to return the maximum sum of the triplet. Ensure your final implementation returns this value correctly, and consider what your return type should be."

      "content": "Finally, try to outline your approach in pseudocode. For instance, how would you initialize your variables, and what conditions will you check as you loop through the list? This will help solidify your understanding before coding."
