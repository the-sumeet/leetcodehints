      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input. You have an array `nums` and a list of queries, where each query specifies a range and a value to decrement. Make sure you can visualize how each query affects the `nums` array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can apply each query to the `nums` array. For each query, you can choose how much to decrement each element in the specified range independently. Think about how this flexibility can help you reach zero values in `nums`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on the maximum values in `nums`. For the array to become a Zero Array, each element must be reduced to zero. This means that the total decrements applied to each index must be at least equal to the value at that index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you process the queries, keep track of how much you can decrement each index in `nums`. You might want to maintain a separate array to track the total decrements available for each index after processing a certain number of queries."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to determine when you can stop processing queries. You need to find the minimum `k` such that after processing the first `k` queries, all elements in `nums` can be decremented to zero."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where `nums` already contains zeros. If `nums` is already a Zero Array at the start, the answer should be `0` since no queries are needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to implement a simulation of applying the queries one by one. After each query, check if the current state of `nums` can be reduced to a Zero Array using the decrements allowed by the queries processed so far."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking if `nums` can be transformed into a Zero Array, remember that the total decrements for each index must not exceed the available decrements from the queries applied. This can be checked using a loop."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you reach the end of the queries and `nums` is still not a Zero Array, ensure you return `-1` as specified in the problem statement. This indicates that it's impossible to transform `nums` into a Zero Array with the given queries."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about optimizing your approach. Instead of applying each query in a brute-force manner, consider using a difference array technique to efficiently apply the decrements over a range in `nums`."
