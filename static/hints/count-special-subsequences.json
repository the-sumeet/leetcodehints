    {
      "content": "Remember that there must be at least one element between each pair of indices. This means you can't have consecutive indices. For example, if p is at index 0, q must be at least index 2."

      "content": "Consider using nested loops to explore potential combinations of indices. The outer loop can iterate over p, and then you can have inner loops for q, r, and s. Ensure that each inner loop respects the index constraints."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate, keep track of the products you need to compare: nums[p] * nums[r] and nums[q] * nums[s]. You can store these products in a temporary variable to avoid repeated calculations."

      "content": "To optimize your solution, think about how you can reduce the number of checks. For instance, if nums[p] * nums[r] is already larger than any possible nums[q] * nums[s], you can break out of the loop early."
