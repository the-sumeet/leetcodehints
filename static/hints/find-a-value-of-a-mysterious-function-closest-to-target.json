      "content": "Consider what the absolute difference `|func(arr, l, r) - target|` represents. You want to minimize this difference, which means you need to evaluate how close `func(arr, l, r)` can get to the `target`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that `l` and `r` can be the same, which means you can call `func` on single elements of the array. This gives you a starting point to evaluate individual elements against the target."

    {
      "content": "Think about the range of `l` and `r`. Both indices can range from `0` to `arr.length - 1`. This gives you a total of `(n * (n + 1)) / 2` pairs to evaluate, which can be significant for larger arrays."

      "content": "To efficiently find the minimum difference, consider storing the results of `func(arr, l, r)` in a list or set. This allows you to quickly compare the results against the target."

      "content": "As you evaluate pairs `(l, r)`, keep track of the minimum difference found so far. This will help you avoid unnecessary calculations once you find a value that meets your criteria."
