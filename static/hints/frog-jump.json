      "content": "Consider the implications of the sorted nature of the stones. Since the stones are in ascending order, the frog can only move forward and cannot jump backward."

      "content": "You might want to create a helper function that checks if the frog can jump from one stone to the next based on the jump size. This will help isolate the jumping logic."

      "content": "Remember that the frog can only land on stones. If there's a gap larger than the maximum possible jump (which is k + 1), the frog cannot proceed."

      "content": "When implementing your search, be mindful of visited states. You want to avoid re-exploring the same stone with the same jump size to prevent infinite loops."

      "content": "When testing your solution, include edge cases such as the minimum number of stones and maximum gaps between stones to ensure robustness."
