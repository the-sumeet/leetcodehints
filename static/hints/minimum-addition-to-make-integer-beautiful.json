      "content": "Consider how adding a non-negative integer x to n affects its digit sum. When you add a number, you might change the digits of n, especially when carrying occurs. For instance, adding 4 to 16 gives you 20, which changes the digit sum."

      "content": "Keep in mind that when n is close to a round number (like 100, 200, etc.), adding a small x can drastically change the digit sum. This is due to the carry effect in decimal addition."

      "content": "You might want to think about how to efficiently find the next number that will have a digit sum less than or equal to the target. This could involve rounding n up to the nearest 'beautiful' number."
