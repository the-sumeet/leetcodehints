Make sure you grasp the difference between the total number of integers processed and the last `k` integers."

      "content": "Consider how you will store the integers that are added to the stream. You could use a list or a queue to keep track of the last `k` integers. Think about how you will manage the size of this storage as new integers are added."

      "content": "Remember that if fewer than `k` integers have been added, the method should return `false`. This means you need to check the count of integers before performing any comparisons."

      "content": "When implementing the `consec` method, focus on how to efficiently determine if the last `k` integers are all equal to `value`. You might want to maintain a count of how many consecutive integers equal `value` you've seen."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `k` is 1. In this case, any single integer added to the stream should return `true` if it equals `value` and `false` otherwise."

      "content": "Make sure to update your count of consecutive integers whenever a new integer is added. If the new integer is equal to `value`, increment your count; otherwise, reset it to zero."

      "content": "Finally, think about how to structure your class. You will need instance variables for `value`, `k`, a list to store the integers, and a counter for the number of consecutive `value` integers. Ensure you initialize these properly in the constructor."
