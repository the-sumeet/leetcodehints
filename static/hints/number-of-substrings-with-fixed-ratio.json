      "content": "Think about how to count the '0's and '1's in any substring. You can use two pointers or a sliding window approach to explore substrings efficiently."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the ratio as a fraction. For example, a ratio of 1:2 can be represented as a fraction of 1/2. This will help in comparing counts of '0's and '1's in a substring."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the string, maintain a count of '0's and '1's. You can use a hashmap to store the counts as you progress through the string, which will help in quickly checking if a substring meets the ratio condition."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, make sure to test it with various edge cases, such as strings composed entirely of '0's or '1's, and very short strings. How do these cases affect your logic?"
