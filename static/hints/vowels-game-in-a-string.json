      "content": "Consider how Alice and Bob can only remove substrings based on the count of vowels they contain. Alice can only remove substrings with an odd number of vowels, while Bob can only remove substrings with an even number of vowels."

      "content": "Think about the initial state of the game. If the string has no vowels at all, Alice cannot make a move, and she loses immediately. What happens if the string has only one vowel?"

      "content": "When analyzing the game, consider the total number of vowels in the entire string. This total will influence the possible moves for both players. If the total is odd, what does that mean for Alice's chances?"

      "content": "Evaluate the game state after each turn. If you can determine that Bob will always be left with an even number of vowels after Alice's turn, you can conclude Alice's victory."
