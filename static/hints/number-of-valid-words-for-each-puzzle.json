      "content": "Next, think about how to verify that all letters in a word are also in the puzzle. A good approach might be to use a set for the characters in the puzzle for O(1) lookups."

      "content": "Remember that each puzzle string has a fixed length of 7 characters, and they do not contain repeated characters. This can simplify your checks."

      "content": "You will need to iterate through each word and check it against each puzzle. Consider using nested loops for this, but be mindful of performance."

      "content": "When checking if a word is valid, you could use a loop to go through each character of the word and see if it exists in the puzzle set."
