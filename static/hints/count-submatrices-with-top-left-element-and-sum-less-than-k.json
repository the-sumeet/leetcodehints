    {
      "content": "To find the sum of elements in a submatrix, consider how to efficiently compute the sum for various bottom-right corners. You can use a prefix sum array to help with this. The prefix sum allows you to calculate the sum of any submatrix in constant time after an initial setup."

    {
      "content": "Construct the prefix sum array such that each entry at (i, j) contains the sum of all elements in the submatrix from (0, 0) to (i, j). This will help you quickly compute the sum of any submatrix that includes the top-left corner."

      "content": "When calculating the sum of a submatrix defined by (0, 0) to (i, j), you can use the prefix sum array as follows: sum = prefix[i][j]. Ensure you handle edge cases where i or j is 0 to avoid accessing out-of-bounds indices."

      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the possible bottom-right corners. You will need two nested loops: one for the row index and one for the column index, both starting from 0 and going up to the dimensions of the matrix."
