      "content": "Try to visualize the strings in terms of their even and odd indexed characters. For example, if you have indices 0, 2, 4 as even and 1, 3, 5 as odd, think about how you can rearrange characters within these groups."

      "content": "Count the occurrences of each character in both strings. For the strings to be made equal, the frequency of characters in the even indexed positions of s1 must match those in s2, and the same must hold for odd indexed positions."
