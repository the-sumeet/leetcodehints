      "content": "Start by understanding what a subsequence is. A subsequence can be formed by deleting some elements of the array while maintaining the order of the remaining elements. For example, from [1, 2, 3], you can form [1, 3] or [2] or even [1, 2, 3] itself."

    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints given in the problem. The condition j - i <= k means that the indices of the selected elements in the subsequence must not be too far apart. Think about how this might limit your choices for forming the subsequence."

      "content": "Think about how you can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum sum at each index. You might want to maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a valid subsequence ending at index `i`."

    {
      "content": "As you build your `dp` array, remember to consider the last `k` elements before the current index `i`. You can only add `nums[i]` to the sum of these previous elements if they are within the distance constraint."

      "content": "Initialize your `dp` array with the values from `nums`, since the minimum valid subsequence at each index is the element itself. This also helps in handling edge cases where all elements might be negative."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the array to fill your `dp` array, ensure that you handle the case where `i < k`. For these indices, you can only consider the elements before `i` that are valid according to the subsequence rules."
