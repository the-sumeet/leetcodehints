    "An island is defined as a group of positive integers connected 4-directionally.",
    "You must return the count of islands with a total value that is divisible by k.",
    "The grid can be as large as 1000 x 1000, so efficiency is important.",
    "Ensure you handle cases with zeros correctly, as they do not contribute to islands.",
    "The total value of an island must be calculated before checking divisibility."
