      "content": "Consider how to create a function that maintains state between calls. You might want to use a closure to encapsulate the variable that tracks the current count."

      "content": "Remember that the counter should return the same starting value 'n' on the first call. This means your function should have a way to differentiate between the first call and the subsequent calls."

      "content": "When implementing the counter, think about how you can increment the value after the first call. You can use a simple variable to keep track of how many times the function has been called."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the case when 'n' is negative. The counter should still work correctly and return values in increasing order, starting from 'n'."

      "content": "Ensure that your function can handle the edge case where the calls array is empty. In this case, the function should not perform any operations and simply return an empty array."

      "content": "Think about the return format. You need to return an array of integers that represent the results of each call to the counter function. Each element corresponds to the result of a call in the order they were made."

      "content": "As a final step, implement the counter function and test it with various inputs, including edge cases like the maximum and minimum values for 'n', and an empty calls array."

      "content": "Hereâ€™s a near-solution hint: You can define your counter function that returns another function. Inside this inner function, maintain a variable to keep track of the current count and increment it each time the function is called."
