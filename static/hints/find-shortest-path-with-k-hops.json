    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the graph. An adjacency list or a matrix could be useful. Each edge contains a source, destination, and weight, which you will need to consider when calculating paths."

      "content": "Consider the implications of K hops. This means you can take up to K edges to reach the destination. What happens if K is 0? Make sure to handle this edge case."

    {
      "content": "When traversing the graph, keep track of the current node, the number of hops taken, and the total cost to reach that node. This will help you determine if you can continue or if you've reached your destination."

      "content": "Make sure to check if the destination node is reachable within the given K hops. If not, you should return a specific value, such as -1, to indicate that the destination cannot be reached."
