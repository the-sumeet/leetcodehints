    {
      "content": "Think about the minimum number of cards required to build a certain number of houses. For example, how many cards do you need to build just one house? This will help you establish a baseline."

      "content": "Consider the recursive nature of the problem. If you can build 'n' houses, how can you express the number of cards used in terms of the previous number of houses? This might lead you towards a formula."

      "content": "Examine small values of 'n' (like 1, 2, or 3) to see how many cards are used in each case. Create a table to visualize the relationship between the number of houses and the number of cards."
