      "content": "Consider how you can represent the painting of these intervals. You might want to visualize them on a number line to see how they overlap."

      "content": "Think about how to merge overlapping intervals. If two intervals share a boundary or overlap, they should be combined into a single interval."

    {
      "content": "Before merging, sort the intervals by their starting points. This will help you easily identify overlaps as you iterate through the list."
    },
    {
      "content": "When merging, keep track of the current interval you're building. If the next interval overlaps with it, extend the current interval; otherwise, finalize the current interval and start a new one."

    {
      "content": "After merging, you will have a list of non-overlapping intervals. The next step is to calculate the area painted each day."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the area painted each day, you need to determine the length of each merged interval. The length can be calculated as the difference between the end and start of the interval."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where intervals touch but do not overlap. For example, intervals [1, 4] and [4, 7] should be treated as separate."

      "content": "As you calculate the area, think about how to store the results. A list or an array might be useful to keep track of the area painted each day."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to return the areas in the order they were painted. This means maintaining the order of the input intervals or the order of the merged intervals."
