      "content": "Start by understanding the definition of K-increasing. An array is K-increasing if for every index `i` where `k <= i < n`, the condition `arr[i-k] <= arr[i]` holds."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can break down the array into multiple subsequences based on the value of `k`. For example, if `k = 2`, you can separate the array into two subsequences: one containing elements at even indices and another at odd indices."

      "content": "For each subsequence, your goal is to make it non-decreasing. Think about how you can determine the minimum number of changes required to achieve this for a single subsequence."

    {
      "content": "To make a subsequence non-decreasing, you might want to find the longest non-decreasing subsequence (LNDS). The number of operations needed will be the total length of the subsequence minus the length of this LNDS."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use dynamic programming or binary search to efficiently find the LNDS. Remember that the LNDS can be found in O(n log n) time."

      "content": "When calculating the operations for each subsequence, ensure you are correctly indexing into the original array. Pay attention to how you are mapping indices back to the original array."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to the length of the array. In this case, the entire array is treated as a single subsequence."

    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your approach with small arrays first. For example, try with `arr = [1, 2, 3]` and `k = 1` to see if your logic holds."

      "content": "Remember that the constraints state `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`. Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of this constraint."

      "content": "If you find that your solution is too slow, look for opportunities to optimize your subsequence calculations. Can you reduce the number of comparisons?"
