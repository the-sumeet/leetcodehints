      "content": "Consider how you can represent a partition. A partition can be represented by its starting and ending indices. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], the partitioning could be represented as (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), etc."

      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to create partitions. You can use a nested loop where the outer loop represents the starting index and the inner loop represents the ending index of the subarrays."
