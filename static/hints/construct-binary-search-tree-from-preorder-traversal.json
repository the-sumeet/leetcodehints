In a BST, for any given node, all values in the left subtree are less than the node's value, and all values in the right subtree are greater. This property will guide how you construct the tree from the preorder array."

      "content": "Remember that the first element in the preorder array is always the root of the BST. For example, in the array [8,5,1,7,10,12], 8 is the root."

      "content": "As you traverse the preorder array, you can determine which values belong to the left and right subtrees based on the root's value. Values less than the root go to the left, and values greater go to the right."

      "content": "Consider using a recursive approach to build the tree. You can create a helper function that takes the current bounds (min and max) for the node values. This will help you decide where to place the next node as you traverse the array."
