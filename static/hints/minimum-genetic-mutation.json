    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the connections between gene strings. You can think of each valid gene string as a node in a graph, where an edge exists between two nodes if one can be mutated into the other by changing a single character."

    {
      "content": "You will need a way to track the number of mutations. A breadth-first search (BFS) approach is suitable here, as it explores all possible mutations level by level, ensuring that you find the shortest path to the endGene."

      "content": "Remember to keep track of visited gene strings to avoid cycles and redundant work. You can use a set to store the visited genes."
