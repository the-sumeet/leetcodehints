      "content": "When inserting a new pair, you need to check if it is the next expected `idKey`. This means you should keep track of the last inserted `idKey` to determine the starting point for returning values. What variable could you use for this?"

      "content": "Remember that the output of the `insert` method should be a list of values that are contiguous and in the correct order.
