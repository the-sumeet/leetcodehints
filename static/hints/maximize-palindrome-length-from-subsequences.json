      "content": "Consider the properties of a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for a string to be a palindrome, the characters must be symmetrically arranged around a center."

      "content": "Think about how you can combine subsequences from both strings. You need to select subsequences from both word1 and word2 and concatenate them. This means you need to analyze the characters in both strings."

      "content": "Think about how to handle characters that appear only once in either string. These can potentially be used as the center of the palindrome, but only one such character can be used."
