      "content": "Consider what data you need to store for each video. Each video might need an ID, a view count, like and dislike counts, and possibly a list of user interactions."

      "content": "When implementing the `upload` method, ensure that you are adding a new video to your data structure. You might want to check if the video ID already exists to prevent duplicates."

      "content": "In the `remove` method, think about how to identify the video to be removed. You will need to maintain a way to reference videos, likely through their unique IDs."

      "content": "The `watch` method should increment the view count for a video. Make sure to handle cases where the video ID does not exist gracefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement the `like` and `dislike` methods. These methods should modify the like and dislike counts respectively and should also check if the video exists before modifying counts."

    {
      "content": "For the `getLikesAndDislikes` method, you need to return both the like and dislike counts for a specific video. Ensure you return them in the correct format, such as a tuple or an array."

      "content": "Pay attention to the order of operations. For example, if a video is removed before it is watched, how should your methods react? This will help you design robust error handling."
