      "content": "Remember that the array can contain duplicates. This means that elements can repeat, which may affect how you decide to narrow down your search space."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you would normally find the minimum in a sorted array. In a non-rotated sorted array, the minimum is simply the first element. However, in a rotated array, the minimum will be somewhere between the rotation point and the end of the array."

    {
      "content": "You can use a binary search approach to find the minimum. Start by defining two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the bounds of your search space."

      "content": "In each iteration of your binary search, calculate the middle index. Compare the middle element with the rightmost element to determine which half of the array is sorted."
    },
    {
      "content": "If the middle element is less than the rightmost element, it means the minimum must be in the left half, so you can adjust your `right` pointer. Conversely, if the middle element is greater, the minimum is in the right half."

      "content": "When the middle element is equal to the rightmost element, you cannot determine which half is sorted. In this case, decrement the `right` pointer to skip the duplicate."

    {
      "content": "Consider the time complexity of your approach. The binary search method should ideally run in O(log n) time, but due to duplicates, it may degrade to O(n) in the worst case."

      "content": "Think about how you will return the result. You need to return the minimum element found in the array, so ensure your function has a return statement that outputs this value."
