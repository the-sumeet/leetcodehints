      "content": "Start by understanding the transformation sequence. Each word in the sequence must differ by exactly one letter from the previous word. This means that for any two words to be adjacent in the sequence, they must have the same length and differ by one character."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to efficiently check if two words differ by one letter. You can create a helper function that takes two words and counts the number of differing characters. If the count is exactly one, they can be adjacent in the sequence."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the words and their relationships. A graph representation can be useful, where each word is a node and an edge exists between two nodes if the words differ by one letter."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since you need to find the shortest transformation sequence, consider using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach. BFS is ideal for unweighted graphs and will help you explore all possible transformations level by level."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before starting the BFS, check if the endWord is in the wordList. If it is not, you can immediately return 0 because a transformation sequence cannot be formed."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing BFS, use a queue to keep track of the current word and the number of steps taken to reach it. Initialize the queue with the beginWord and a step count of 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you dequeue a word, generate all possible transformations by changing each letter to every other letter from 'a' to 'z'. For each valid transformation that exists in the wordList, enqueue it with an incremented step count."

    {
      "content": "Keep track of visited words to avoid cycles and unnecessary processing. You can use a set to store words that have already been processed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to stop the BFS when you reach the endWord. At that point, you can return the step count, which represents the length of the shortest transformation sequence."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be cautious about edge cases, such as when the wordList is empty or when the beginWord and endWord are the same. Ensure your code handles these cases gracefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints given in the problem. For instance, all words are guaranteed to be of the same length, and the number of words in the wordList can be quite large (up to 5000). Your solution should be efficient enough to handle these limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "When generating transformations, ensure that you only consider words that are in the wordList. This can be efficiently checked using a set for O(1) average time complexity."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you exhaust the queue without finding the endWord, it means no valid transformation sequence exists. In this case, you should return 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases like having multiple valid transformation paths. Your BFS will naturally find the shortest one, but ensure you understand how to manage multiple paths if needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, make sure to test your implementation with various cases, including those where the transformation is possible and where it is not. This will help you ensure robustness."
