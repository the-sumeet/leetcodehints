    {
      "content": "When you swap a subarray `nums1[left...right]` with `nums2[left...right]`, the new sums can be calculated as: \n`new_sum1 = sum1 - sum(nums1[left...right]) + sum(nums2[left...right])` \n`new_sum2 = sum2 - sum(nums2[left...right]) + sum(nums1[left...right])`."

      "content": "Notice that the change in score due to a swap can be expressed as the difference between the sums of the swapped elements. This means you can focus on the net gain or loss from the swap."

      "content": "Keep in mind that if you choose not to swap any subarrays, the score remains `max(sum1, sum2)`. This means your final answer must consider both the original sums and the possible new sums after swaps."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through possible `left` and `right` indices, maintain a running total of the sums for the current subarray being considered. This will help in efficiently calculating the new sums after a swap."
