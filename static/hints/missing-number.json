    {
      "content": "Think about how you can leverage the sum of the first n natural numbers. The formula for the sum of the first n integers is \\( \\text{sum} = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). This could help you find the missing number by comparing it to the sum of the numbers in the array."

      "content": "Before implementing the sum approach, ensure you calculate the correct value of n. Remember, n is the length of the array, which indicates how many numbers should be present including the missing one."

      "content": "When you calculate the sum of the numbers in the array, remember to use a loop or a built-in function to iterate through the array. You will then subtract this sum from the expected sum calculated using the formula."

    {
      "content": "If you decide to use the XOR method, remember that XORing a number with itself results in 0, and XORing any number with 0 results in the number itself. This property can help you isolate the missing number."
