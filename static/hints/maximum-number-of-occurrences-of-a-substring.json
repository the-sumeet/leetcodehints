      "content": "Start by considering the constraints of the problem. You need to find substrings of a given string `s` that meet specific criteria regarding their length and the number of unique characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the substring length must be between `minSize` and `maxSize`. This means you should focus on substrings of lengths that fall within this range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay special attention to the `maxLetters` constraint. This limits the number of unique characters in any valid substring. You might want to use a frequency count to track the number of unique characters in each substring."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a sliding window approach to efficiently generate and check substrings of the required lengths. This can help you avoid generating all possible substrings separately."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you generate substrings, keep a count of their occurrences. A dictionary (or hashmap) could be useful here to map each substring to its count."

    {
      "content": "When checking the number of unique characters, you can maintain a set or a simple array to track character counts. This will help you quickly determine if a substring meets the `maxLetters` condition."

    {
      "content": "Don't forget to consider overlapping substrings. The problem states that occurrences can overlap, so make sure your algorithm accounts for this when counting."

    {
      "content": "Once you have counted the occurrences of all valid substrings, you need to determine the maximum count. This will be your final answer."

    {
      "content": "Be mindful of edge cases, such as when `s` is very short or when all characters are the same. These can impact your substring generation and counting logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints. Think about the time complexity of your approach and how you can optimize it."
