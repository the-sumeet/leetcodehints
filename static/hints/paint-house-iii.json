    {
      "content": "Identify how neighborhoods are formed. A neighborhood is a continuous segment of houses painted the same color. Consider how changing the color of a house affects the neighborhood count."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the cost matrix `cost`. Each entry `cost[i][j]` represents the cost to paint house `i` with color `j + 1`. This means you need to adjust your indexing when accessing this matrix."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the `target` neighborhoods. If the initial count of neighborhoods from the already painted houses exceeds `target`, it's impossible to achieve the goal. You should return -1 in that case."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where all houses are already painted. If the number of neighborhoods matches `target`, return 0 since no additional cost is needed."

      "content": "Use dynamic programming to approach this problem. Define a state that keeps track of the current house index, the number of neighborhoods formed so far, and the last color used."

    {
      "content": "Your DP state could look like this: `dp[i][k][c]`, where `i` is the current house index, `k` is the number of neighborhoods, and `c` is the last color used. This helps in managing transitions efficiently."

      "content": "When transitioning between states in your DP, consider the cost of painting the current house in different colors. If you paint it the same color as the last one, it won't change the neighborhood count."

      "content": "If you paint the current house a different color, you will need to increment the neighborhood count. Make sure to account for the cost of painting when updating your DP state."
