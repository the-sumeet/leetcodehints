    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will identify whether a word in the sentence can be replaced by a root. A word can be replaced if it starts with a root from the dictionary. Think about how you can check this efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "To keep track of the shortest root for each derivative, you might want to use a data structure that allows for easy comparison. A list or a set can be useful for storing roots, but you may need to check each root against the words in the sentence."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing the sentence, split it into individual words. You can use the `split()` method in Python to create a list of words. This will help you iterate through each word and check for replacements."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you check each word, remember that you need to find the shortest root. You can keep a variable to track the shortest root found so far for each word. If a shorter root is found, update this variable."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where a word may not have any corresponding root. In such cases, the original word should remain unchanged in the final sentence."

    {
      "content": "Once you have processed all the words in the sentence, you'll need to join them back together into a single string. The `join()` method can be used for this purpose, ensuring that words are separated by spaces."

      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your solution. Since the sentence can be quite long, you should aim for a solution that minimizes unnecessary checks. A trie data structure could be beneficial here for storing the roots."
