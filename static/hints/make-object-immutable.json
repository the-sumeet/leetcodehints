      "content": "Consider how JavaScript handles object properties. You might want to explore methods like `Object.freeze()` which can prevent modifications to an object."

      "content": "Think about the implications of immutability on nested objects. If an object contains other objects or arrays, freezing the outer object alone won't prevent changes to the inner objects."
    },
    {
      "content": "When dealing with arrays, remember that methods like `push()`, `pop()`, or direct indexing can mutate the original array. You may need to create a new array instead of modifying the existing one."

      "content": "Explore how to create a deep copy of an object. This can help ensure that nested objects are also immutable. Consider using techniques like recursion or libraries that provide deep cloning."

      "content": "Think about how you can use `Object.defineProperty()` to create properties that are non-writable. This can be useful for making individual properties immutable."

      "content": "Consider using a combination of `Object.freeze()` and `Object.keys()` to iterate over properties and apply immutability to each one. This can help in ensuring that all properties are protected."
