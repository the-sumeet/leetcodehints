      "content": "Consider the base cases. If the desiredTotal is 0, the first player automatically wins since they don't need to pick any number. What happens when desiredTotal is less than or equal to maxChoosableInteger?"

      "content": "Explore the scenario where the first player cannot win immediately. In such cases, the first player must consider how to limit the second player's options. How might the first player choose a number to force a win on subsequent turns?"

      "content": "Remember to keep track of which numbers have been used. You can use a bitmask or a set to represent the available numbers, which will help in managing the state of the game."
