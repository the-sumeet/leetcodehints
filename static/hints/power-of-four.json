      "content": "First, consider the definition of a power of four. An integer n is a power of four if there exists an integer x such that n = 4^x. This means n can be expressed as 1, 4, 16, 64, etc."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the properties of powers of four. Notice that they are always positive integers. Therefore, if n is less than or equal to zero, you can immediately return false."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to check if n is exactly 1. Remember that 4^0 equals 1, which is a power of four. How would you handle this case in your code?"

      "content": "Consider how you can determine if a number is a power of four without using loops or recursion. What mathematical properties or operations could help you?"
    },
    {
      "content": "One approach is to repeatedly divide n by 4. If you can keep dividing n by 4 until it equals 1, then n is a power of four. However, think about how to do this without a loop."

      "content": "Another approach is to use logarithms. You can calculate log base 4 of n and check if the result is an integer. How would you implement this?"

    {
      "content": "If you choose to use logarithms, remember that you can convert log base 4 to log base 10 or natural log using the change of base formula. This could help you avoid precision issues."

      "content": "Consider using bit manipulation. Powers of four have a unique pattern in their binary representation. Can you find a way to leverage this pattern to determine if n is a power of four?"

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, especially the limits of n as specified in the constraints. Ensure your solution works for the maximum and minimum values of n."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you would return the result. The function should return true or false based on whether n is a power of four. Make sure your logic leads to this clear output."
