    {
      "content": "Consider the effect of the AND operation. The result of `a & b` will always be less than or equal to both `a` and `b`. This means that the overall value of the array can potentially decrease with each operation."

    {
      "content": "Think about how the bitwise OR operation works. The OR operation combines bits, resulting in a number that has bits set wherever at least one of the operands has a bit set."

      "content": "Since you can perform at most `k` operations, consider how to choose which pairs to AND. Not all pairs will lead to a beneficial outcome, so prioritize pairs that yield lower values."

      "content": "If `k` is large enough (greater than or equal to the length of the array minus one), you can potentially reduce the array to a single element. Think about how to minimize the remaining element in that case."

      "content": "Look for opportunities to combine elements that are close in value. Combining similar numbers often yields a smaller result than combining very different numbers."

      "content": "When choosing pairs to AND, consider both the current values and how they will affect the overall OR. For example, combining a high value with a low value may lower the OR more effectively."

      "content": "Keep track of the minimum OR value you can achieve after each operation. This will help you decide whether to continue combining or stop early."

      "content": "You might want to implement a greedy approach where you always combine the pair that currently gives the smallest resulting value. This could lead to a better overall OR."

      "content": "If you reach a point where further operations do not yield a lower OR, you can terminate early. This can save unnecessary computations."

      "content": "Finally, ensure your implementation correctly handles the constraints, especially the bounds on `k` and the length of the array. Edge cases with minimal or maximal values for `k` should be tested."
