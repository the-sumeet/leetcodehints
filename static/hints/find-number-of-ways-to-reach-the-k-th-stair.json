      "content": "Start by understanding the two types of operations Alice can perform. She can either go down to the previous stair (i - 1) or jump up to a higher stair (i + 2 * jump) where 'jump' increases with each jump operation."

      "content": "Consider the base cases for small values of k. For k = 0, Alice can reach it in two different ways. Think about how the operations can be sequenced to achieve the same stair multiple times."

      "content": "When Alice is at stair 1 and wants to reach stair 0, she can directly go down. However, if she jumps first, how does that affect her ability to reach stair 0 again?"

      "content": "Notice that Alice's ability to jump increases with each jump operation. This means that the number of stairs she can potentially reach grows as she performs more jump operations."
