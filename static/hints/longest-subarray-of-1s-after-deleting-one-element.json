    {
      "content": "Consider the edge cases in your input. For example, if the array consists only of 1's, remember that you will still need to delete one element, which will reduce the length of the longest subarray."

      "content": "Think about how you can traverse the array while keeping track of the positions of 1's and 0's. A sliding window approach might be useful here to maintain the count of 1's while considering the deletion of one 0."

    {
      "content": "As you traverse the array, keep a count of the number of 1's in the current window. When you encounter a 0, note the position of the last 0 you saw, as this will help you determine how to adjust your window."

      "content": "Remember that you can only delete one element. If you encounter more than one 0 in your current window, you need to adjust your window to ensure that you are only considering the deletion of one 0."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the boundaries of the array. If the only 0 is at the start or end, ensure your logic correctly calculates the length of 1's in those scenarios."
