      "content": "Consider how to detect cycles in the graph. A cycle means that you cannot find a valid path, and the problem requires you to return -1 in that case. You might want to use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting."

      "content": "When traversing the graph, keep track of the colors of the nodes you visit. You need to count the occurrences of each color along the path you take. How will you store these counts?"
