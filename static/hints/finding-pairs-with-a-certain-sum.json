      "content": "To optimize the counting process, consider using a hash map (or dictionary) to store the frequency of each value in `nums2`. This way, you can quickly look up how many times a specific complement exists in `nums2`."

      "content": "When counting pairs, for each element in `nums1`, calculate the complement needed from `nums2` to reach the target total. For example, if `tot` is 7 and `nums1[i]` is 2, the complement would be `7 - 2 = 5`."
