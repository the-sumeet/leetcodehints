    {
      "content": "For the first pattern, check if the `dna_sequence` starts with 'ATG'. You can use string methods available in SQL to accomplish this. Think about how you would write a condition to check the beginning of a string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, focus on the stop codons. You need to check if the sequence ends with 'TAA', 'TAG', or 'TGA'. You can use the `LIKE` operator in SQL for this. Remember to account for the length of the sequences when checking the end."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the third pattern, you need to determine if the sequence contains the motif 'ATAT'. Consider using the `LIKE` operator again, but this time to check for the presence of a substring anywhere in the `dna_sequence`."

      "content": "The last pattern requires checking for at least three consecutive 'G's. You can use a pattern like 'GGG%' in your `LIKE` condition. Think about how you can structure this to ensure it captures any occurrence of 'GGG' or more."
