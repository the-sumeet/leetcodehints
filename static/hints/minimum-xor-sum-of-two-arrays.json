      "content": "Start by understanding what XOR is and how it operates. Remember that for any integer `a`, `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`. This means that if two numbers are the same, their XOR will contribute nothing to the sum."

    {
      "content": "Consider the properties of XOR. For two numbers, the XOR result tends to be smaller when the bits of the numbers are similar. Try to visualize how the bits align when performing XOR operations."

      "content": "Think about how you can rearrange `nums2`. Since you want to minimize the XOR sum, you should aim to pair elements from `nums1` with elements from `nums2` that yield the smallest XOR values."

    {
      "content": "Since the length of the arrays is small (up to 14), you might consider generating all permutations of `nums2`. This brute-force approach could help you find the minimum XOR sum by evaluating every possible arrangement."

      "content": "When generating permutations, remember to use a method that ensures you go through all possible arrangements. In Python, for example, you can use `itertools.permutations` to generate all permutations of `nums2`."

      "content": "As you calculate the XOR sums for each permutation, keep track of the minimum value you encounter. You can initialize a variable to store the minimum XOR sum and update it whenever you find a smaller value."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when both arrays contain the same elements. How would this affect the XOR sum? Would you still need to rearrange `nums2`?"
