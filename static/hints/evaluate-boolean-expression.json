    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will represent the variables in your code. You might want to use a dictionary or a map to store the variable names as keys and their corresponding values as values for easy access."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, focus on how to evaluate the expressions. You will need to parse each expression and determine what operation to perform based on the operator provided (e.g., '>', '<', '=', etc.)."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the operators you will handle are relational. Make sure you understand how each operator behaves with respect to the values you have. For example, what does '>' mean when comparing two integers?"

      "content": "Think about how to handle the evaluation of each expression. You can use conditional statements to check which operator is being used and then perform the appropriate comparison, returning a boolean result."

    {
      "content": "You should also think about the order of operations. If you have multiple expressions, how will you evaluate them in sequence? Will you store the results, or will you evaluate them one by one?"

      "content": "Make sure to handle potential errors, such as referencing a variable that does not exist in your dictionary. What will your code do in such cases? Consider implementing error handling or default behavior."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider how you will return the results of the evaluations. Will you return a list of boolean values corresponding to each expression, or will you return a single boolean result based on some criteria?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, put everything together. Loop through the expressions, evaluate each one using the variables, and collect the results. Ensure that your code is clean and well-commented for readability."
