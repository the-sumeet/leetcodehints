    {
      "content": "Consider how threading works in this context. You will need to ensure that `foo()` and `bar()` are called alternately. This means that after `foo()` prints 'foo', `bar()` should print 'bar' before the next call to `foo()`."

      "content": "Think about synchronization between the two threads. You can use synchronization primitives like `wait()` and `notify()` or `Lock` objects to control the access to the methods."

    {
      "content": "You might want to create a shared state or flag that indicates whether it's currently `foo`'s or `bar`'s turn to print. This will help you manage the alternation between the two methods."

      "content": "You can outline the flow of your program: when `foo()` is called, it should print 'foo' and then signal `bar()` to print 'bar'. This signaling can be done using `notify()` after printing."

      "content": "Consider how to structure your threads. You can create two separate threads for `foo` and `bar`. Ensure that they both share the same instance of `FooBar`."
