      "content": "Consider how the malware spreads. If a node is infected, it can infect all directly connected nodes. Thus, the spread of malware is effectively a graph traversal problem."

      "content": "Keep in mind that you need to find the node whose removal minimizes the total number of infected nodes. Therefore, you'll need to compare the results of removing each node in `initial`."
