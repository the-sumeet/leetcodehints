      "content": "For each query in wordsQuery, you need to compare it against all strings in wordsContainer to find the longest common suffix. Think about how you can extract the suffix from both the query and the words in the container."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a nested loop where the outer loop iterates over wordsQuery and the inner loop iterates over wordsContainer. This will allow you to compare each query with every string in the container."

      "content": "When comparing the suffixes, remember to check if the suffix of the query matches the suffix of the word in the container. You can do this by using string slicing in Python or similar methods in other languages."

      "content": "Keep track of the longest common suffix found for each query. You may want to use a variable to store the maximum length of the suffix and the corresponding index of the word in wordsContainer."

      "content": "If you find multiple words with the same longest suffix, you need to apply the tie-breaking rules: choose the shortest word first, and if there's still a tie, choose the one that appears first in wordsContainer."

      "content": "To efficiently compare suffixes, you might want to reverse the strings in both wordsContainer and wordsQuery. This way, you can directly compare prefixes instead of suffixes."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the query might not match any suffix in wordsContainer. In such cases, the longest common suffix is an empty string, and you should still return an index based on the tie-breaking rules."

      "content": "Make sure to initialize your result array with the same length as wordsQuery, as you will be storing the index of the best match for each query."
