      "content": "When you concatenate binary strings, ensure that you are not introducing leading zeros. For example, the binary representation of 1 is '1', and of 2 is '10'. Concatenating them as '1' + '10' = '110'."

      "content": "After generating the binary strings for all permutations, you will need to convert the concatenated binary string back to a decimal integer. Use `int(binary_string, 2)` to convert it."
