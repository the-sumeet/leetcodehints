      "content": "Start by understanding the input structure. You have an integer `n` for the number of players and a 2D array `pick`, where each entry represents a player's action of picking a ball of a certain color."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that players are indexed from 0 to n-1. Player `i` needs to pick at least `i + 1` balls of the same color to win. This means you need to keep track of the counts of balls picked by each player."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a dictionary or a list of dictionaries to count the number of balls picked by each player for each color. This will help you easily check how many balls of a specific color each player has picked."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the `pick` array, update the counts for each player and their corresponding ball color. For example, if `pick[i] = [x, y]`, increment the count for player `x` and color `y`."

    {
      "content": "After processing all picks, you need to check each playerâ€™s counts. For player `i`, check if they have picked at least `i + 1` balls of any color. This is the winning condition."

      "content": "When checking the counts, remember to iterate through the colors for each player. You can use a simple loop to check if any color count meets the winning condition."

      "content": "Don't forget to initialize your data structures properly. Ensure that each player's color count starts from zero before processing the picks."

    },
    {
      "content": "Think about performance. You want to ensure that your solution runs efficiently given the constraints, especially since `pick.length` can be up to 100."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to count how many players meet the winning condition and return that count. Make sure to test your solution with the provided examples to verify correctness."
