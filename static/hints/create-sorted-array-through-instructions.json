      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement. You need to insert elements from the 'instructions' array into a new array 'nums' while calculating the cost based on the current state of 'nums'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the cost of insertion for each element is determined by counting how many elements in 'nums' are strictly less than and strictly greater than the current element."

      "content": "Consider how you will keep track of the elements in 'nums'. A simple array might work, but think about how to efficiently count elements that are less than or greater than the current element."

    {
      "content": "You need to maintain the order of elements in 'nums'. This means that after each insertion, 'nums' should remain sorted. How can you ensure this?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about using a data structure that allows for efficient insertions and queries. A balanced binary search tree or a sorted list could be useful here."
    },
    {
      "content": "When inserting an element, you can use binary search to find the position where the element should go. This can help you quickly count elements that are less than or greater than the current element."

      "content": "Consider using a frequency array or a data structure that allows you to keep track of how many times each number has been inserted. This can help when calculating costs for duplicate numbers."

      "content": "Don't forget to take care of the modulo operation. Since the total cost can be large, you need to return it modulo 10^9 + 7."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when all elements in 'instructions' are the same. How would your cost calculation change in this scenario?"

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will initialize 'nums'. It starts empty, so the first few insertions will have a cost of zero. Keep this in mind as you build your solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to create a helper function to handle the insertion logic and cost calculation. This will make your main loop cleaner and easier to follow."
