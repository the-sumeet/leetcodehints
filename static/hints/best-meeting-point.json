      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement. You need to find the best meeting point for people represented by '1's in a grid, where '0's represent empty spaces."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider what 'best meeting point' means. It typically refers to minimizing the total distance from all '1's to this point. Think about how you would calculate distances."
    },
    {
      "content": "A good approach is to calculate the Manhattan distance, which is the sum of the absolute differences of the coordinates. For two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2), the distance is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to iterate through each cell in the grid. For each cell, calculate the total distance to all '1's. This will help you find the point with the minimum distance."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before diving into coding, consider edge cases. What if there are no '1's in the grid? How should your function handle this situation?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the size of the grid. If it is very large, a brute force approach might be inefficient. Consider optimizing your distance calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can optimize the distance calculation by using the median of the coordinates. The median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations, which can lead to a more efficient solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the median, you can extract the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of all '1's, sort them, and then select the middle value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle cases where the number of '1's is even. In such cases, you may need to consider both middle values for your calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the median coordinates, you can calculate the total distance from all '1's to this point. This will give you the best meeting point."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to consider the return format. Should you return the coordinates of the meeting point, the distance, or both? Clarify this before implementing."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various grid sizes and configurations. Include edge cases like a grid filled entirely with '0's or '1's."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. If you use sorting to find the median, what is the overall complexity of your solution?"
    },
    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure your code is clean and well-commented. This will help you explain your thought process during the interview."
    },
    {
      "content": "You are very close! Consider implementing the logic for distance calculation and median finding in your code. Remember to handle edge cases as you go."

    "The grid is represented as a 2D list of integers, where '1' indicates a person and '0' indicates an empty space.",
    "You must return the coordinates of the best meeting point that minimizes the total distance.",
    "If there are no '1's in the grid, define how your function should behave (e.g., return None or a specific value).",
    "Consider the performance of your solution, especially for larger grids."
