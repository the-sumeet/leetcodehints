      "content": "Start by understanding what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous portion of the array. For example, in the array [10, 20, 30], the subarrays include [10], [20], [30], [10, 20], [20, 30], and [10, 20, 30]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on the concept of 'strictly increasing'. This means that each element in the subarray must be greater than the previous one. For example, [10, 20, 30] is valid, but [10, 20, 20] is not."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can traverse the array to find these increasing subarrays. You might want to use a loop to go through each element and compare it to the previous one."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, keep track of the current sum of the increasing subarray. Whenever you encounter a number that is not greater than the previous one, you should compare the current sum with a maximum sum variable."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to reset the current sum when the ascending order breaks. For instance, if you have [10, 20, 30, 5], when you reach 5, you need to check if the sum of [10, 20, 30] is greater than your maximum sum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the entire array is strictly increasing or where all elements are the same. For example, in [5, 5, 5], the maximum sum should be 5, since no increasing subarray exists."
    },
    {
      "content": "You should also handle the case where the array has only one element. The maximum sum in this case is simply the value of that single element."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you will initialize your maximum sum variable. It could start at 0 or the first element of the array, depending on how you decide to handle the sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you approach the end of the array, ensure that you check the last increasing subarray. The maximum sum could be from the last sequence of increasing numbers."

    {
      "content": "Finally, make sure to return the maximum sum found. You may want to print or log intermediate sums to debug your approach and ensure correctness."
