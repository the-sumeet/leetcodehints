      "content": "Consider the constraints: the array length is between 3 and 12, and all integers are distinct and positive. This allows you to think about using combinations or subsets since the input size is manageable."

      "content": "Think about the properties of multiplication. If you can form one subset with a product equal to the target, what does that imply for the remaining elements? The product of the remaining elements must also equal the target."

      "content": "You can use a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsets. For each element, decide whether to include it in the first subset or not and recursively check the remaining elements."
