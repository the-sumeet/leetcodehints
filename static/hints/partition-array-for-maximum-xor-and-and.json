      "content": "Start by understanding the operations involved: XOR and AND. XOR combines bits such that if the bits are different, the result is 1, and if they are the same, the result is 0. AND results in 1 only if both bits are 1. This difference in behavior will affect how you partition the array."

    {
      "content": "Consider the properties of XOR and AND. XOR is maximized when you have diverse numbers, while AND is maximized when you have similar numbers. Think about how you can leverage these properties in your partitions."

      "content": "For small arrays, try to manually partition them into A, B, and C to see how different combinations affect the total value. This will help you form a strategy for larger arrays."

      "content": "When considering partitions, it may help to first focus on maximizing XOR(A) and XOR(C). After you have chosen A and C, you can then determine the best way to form B."

      "content": "As you explore partitions, calculate the XOR and AND values dynamically. This means as you form A, B, and C, keep a running total of their respective XOR and AND values."

      "content": "Pay attention to the order of operations. XOR and AND are both bitwise operations, and their results can be influenced by the order in which you apply them. Experiment with different orders."

    {
      "content": "As a final step, after exploring partitions, ensure you compare all computed values correctly to return the maximum. This might involve storing the maximum in a variable and updating it as you find larger sums."
