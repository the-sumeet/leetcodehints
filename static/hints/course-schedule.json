      "content": "Think about how you can detect cycles in a directed graph. If there is a cycle, it means that there is no way to complete all the courses."

      "content": "You can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Kahn's algorithm (BFS) to detect cycles. Both approaches can help you determine if you can finish all courses."

      "content": "If you choose DFS, maintain a visited set to track nodes you have already processed. You can also use a recursion stack to detect back edges, which indicate cycles."

    },
    {
      "content": "As a final step, think about how you will structure your function. You will need to take `numCourses` and `prerequisites` as inputs and return a boolean output based on your cycle detection logic."
