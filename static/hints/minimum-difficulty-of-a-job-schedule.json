      "content": "Consider the case where the number of jobs equals 'd'. Each job must be done on a separate day, which means the total difficulty will simply be the sum of the difficulties of each job."

      "content": "Think about how to define the difficulty of a day. The difficulty for a day is determined by the maximum difficulty job completed on that day. This means you need to track the maximum job difficulty for each day."

      "content": "Initialize your DP array carefully. If 'j' is greater than 'i', set dp[i][j] to infinity since you can't schedule more days than jobs."
