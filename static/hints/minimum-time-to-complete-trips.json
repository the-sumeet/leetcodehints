    {
      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the number of trips completed by all buses at a given time. For each bus, the number of trips it can complete by time `t` is given by `t // time[i]`. How would you sum these up for all buses?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find the minimum time required. A brute force approach would be too slow, especially since `totalTrips` can be as large as 10^7. Can you think of a more efficient way, like using binary search?"

      "content": "If you use binary search, what would be your search space? Consider the minimum time (which could be 1) and the maximum time. What would be a reasonable upper bound for the maximum time?"

      "content": "To implement binary search, you need a function that checks if a given time `t` is sufficient to complete at least `totalTrips`. What would the base case for this function look like?"

    {
      "content": "As you implement the binary search, remember to adjust your mid-point and check the total trips completed. If it's greater than or equal to `totalTrips`, you might be able to reduce the time. What conditions will help you decide this?"
