      "content": "Consider what it means for a row to be valid. A row is valid if the number of zeros at the end of the row is at least equal to its row index (0-based). For example, in a row at index 0, there must be at least n zeros."

      "content": "To check if it's possible to make the grid valid, iterate through each row from the bottom to the top. Count the number of zeros from the end of each row and see if it meets the requirement for its index."

      "content": "If any row does not have enough zeros, return -1 immediately. This indicates that it's impossible to achieve a valid grid configuration."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when n is 1. In this case, the grid is already valid, and you should return 0 without any swaps."
