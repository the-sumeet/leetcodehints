      "content": "Consider how you might iterate through the array. You could use a nested loop to check every triplet, but that would be inefficient. Think about how you could reduce the number of comparisons needed."

      "content": "Notice that if you find two numbers that can form the first two parts of the triplet, you only need to check if there exists a third number that is larger than the second. This can help you avoid checking every possible triplet."

      "content": "To keep track of potential candidates for the first two numbers in the triplet, you might want to maintain two variables. Think about what conditions these variables should satisfy as you iterate through the array."
