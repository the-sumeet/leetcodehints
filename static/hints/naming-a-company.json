      "content": "Remember that the names must be distinct. This means you cannot choose the same name for both A and B when forming the new names."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can swap the first letters of two strings. For example, if you have 'coffee' and 'donuts', swapping the first letters would give you 'doffee' and 'conuts'."

      "content": "Be cautious of edge cases where the list has names that are very similar. For instance, names that differ only in the first letter can lead to invalid combinations."

      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where the names are very short or very long. The maximum length of each name is 10 characters."

      "content": "You should also consider the scenario where there are only two names. What happens if you swap the letters? Will it always be invalid?"

      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure to test with various inputs, including edge cases like the minimum number of names and names that are very similar."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize your approach, you will need to: 1) Iterate through pairs of names, 2) Swap their first letters, 3) Check for existence in the original list, and 4) Count distinct valid names."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the result. The problem asks for the number of valid company names, so your final output should be an integer."
