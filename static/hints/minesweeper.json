    "Constraints: 1 <= m, n <= 50; board[i][j] can be 'M', 'E', 'B', or a digit from '1' to '8'.",
    "Indexing: The click coordinates are zero-based.",
    "Return format: The modified board must be returned as a 2D array.",
    "Game rules: Revealing 'M' results in 'X', while 'E' can become 'B' or a digit based on adjacent mines."
