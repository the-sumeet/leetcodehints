    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the lengths of the strings. For s3 to be a valid interleaving of s1 and s2, the length of s3 must equal the sum of the lengths of s1 and s2. If not, you can immediately return false."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. You can create a 2D table where dp[i][j] indicates whether s3 up to index i + j can be formed by interleaving s1 up to index i and s2 up to index j."
    },
    {
      "content": "Initialize your DP table. The base case is dp[0][0] = true, meaning that an empty s1 and s2 can form an empty s3. Make sure to fill in the first row and the first column based on whether the characters match."

    {
      "content": "When filling the DP table, consider two cases for each dp[i][j]: one where the last character of s3 comes from s1 and another where it comes from s2. Make sure to check the corresponding characters in s1 and s2."

    {
      "content": "Remember to check boundary conditions when accessing your DP table. For instance, when checking dp[i-1][j] or dp[i][j-1], ensure that i and j are within valid bounds to avoid index errors."

    {
      "content": "After filling the DP table, the answer will be found in dp[len(s1)][len(s2)]. This tells you if the entire s3 can be formed by interleaving s1 and s2."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when one or both of the strings are empty. For example, if s1 is empty, check if s2 matches s3 directly, and vice versa."

    {
      "content": "If you're looking to optimize space complexity, consider using a 1D array instead of a 2D table. You can keep track of the previous row's results while iterating through s2."
