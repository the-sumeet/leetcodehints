      "content": "Identify the two possible directions to travel between the start and destination stops: clockwise and counterclockwise. Think about how you can calculate the distance for each direction."

    {
      "content": "To calculate the clockwise distance from a stop 'start' to a stop 'destination', you can sum the distances from 'start' to 'destination' directly. Remember to handle the circular nature of the stops."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the counterclockwise distance, you can think of it as going from 'destination' back to 'start'. This can also be calculated by summing the distances in the reverse direction."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using modular arithmetic to handle the circular indexing of the bus stops. For example, when calculating distances, use `(i + 1) % n` to wrap around when you reach the end of the list."

      "content": "Remember to compute both distances (clockwise and counterclockwise) and then return the minimum of the two. This is crucial to ensure you find the shortest path."

      "content": "When implementing your solution, consider using a loop to iterate through the distance array for calculating both distances. You can use a simple for loop for this purpose."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The bus stops are indexed from 0 to n-1.",
    "The distances are given in a circular manner, meaning distance[i] is the distance between stop i and (i + 1) % n.",
    "You must consider both clockwise and counterclockwise distances.",
    "The constraints specify that 1 <= n <= 10^4 and 0 <= distance[i] <= 10^4."
