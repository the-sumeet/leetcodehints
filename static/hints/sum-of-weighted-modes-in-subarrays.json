      "content": "Think about how to handle subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous part of the array. You will need to iterate over all possible subarrays. How would you generate these subarrays from the given array?"

    {
      "content": "When generating subarrays, remember that the start and end indices can vary. For an array of length `n`, the start index can range from `0` to `n-1`, and for each start index, the end index can range from the start index to `n-1`."

    {
      "content": "As you generate subarrays, consider how to find the mode efficiently. You might want to use a frequency map (or dictionary) to count occurrences of each number in the current subarray. This will help you determine the mode more easily."

      "content": "Once you have the mode, think about how to calculate its weight. If the weight is simply the mode's value multiplied by its frequency, ensure you keep track of both as you build your frequency map."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all elements in a subarray are unique. In this case, the mode would be the first element, and its weight would be its value times one. How will your logic handle this scenario?"

    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle ties in modes. If two numbers have the same frequency, you need a rule to determine which one to choose. For example, you might choose the larger number or the first one that appears."

      "content": "Once you calculate the weighted mode for each subarray, think about how to accumulate these values. You will need a variable to keep track of the sum of all weighted modes across all subarrays."

    {
      "content": "To optimize your solution, consider whether you can reuse information from previous subarrays. For instance, if you know the mode of a subarray, how might that help you when expanding the subarray to include one more element?"

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct format. You should return a single integer representing the sum of all weighted modes from all subarrays. Pay attention to any constraints on the input array size or element values."
