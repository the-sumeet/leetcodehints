      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input. You have an array `nums` and a list of operations. Each operation specifies a number to be replaced and the new number to replace it with."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that `nums` contains distinct positive integers. This means that there will be no duplicates in `nums`, which simplifies the replacement process since you won't have to worry about replacing the same number multiple times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Take note of the constraints: both `n` (length of `nums`) and `m` (length of `operations`) can go up to 100,000. This suggests that your solution should be efficient, ideally O(n + m)."
    },
    {
      "content": "When applying the operations, think about how to efficiently find the index of the number to replace. A dictionary (or hash map) can be useful to map numbers to their indices for quick lookups."

    {
      "content": "Consider iterating through the `operations` list. For each operation, you will need to find the index of `operations[i][0]` in `nums` and replace it with `operations[i][1]`."

    {
      "content": "Be cautious about the order of operations. Since each operation guarantees that the number to be replaced exists in `nums`, you can safely perform the replacement without checking for existence each time."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you replace elements, remember that the new number being inserted (`operations[i][1]`) will not already be in `nums`. This ensures that you won't have to deal with conflicts during replacements."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to maintain the integrity of the `nums` array as you perform replacements. You might consider keeping track of the current state of the array after each operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "After processing all operations, ensure that you return the modified `nums` array in the correct format. The output should be a single array containing the final state of `nums`."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize your approach: use a loop to go through each operation, find the index of the number to replace, and perform the replacement. Make sure to handle the output correctly after all operations are applied."
