      "content": "Start by defining the basic structure of the Snake Game. You will need a grid to represent the game area and a way to track the snake's position. Think about how you can represent the snake as a list of coordinates."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the snake grows when it eats food. You might want to maintain a list of the snake's body segments and update this list when the snake moves or eats food."

    {
      "content": "When implementing movement, remember that the snake moves in a specific direction. You can use a direction vector to update the snake's head position based on the current direction."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle boundaries. If the snake moves out of the grid, you need to determine how to handle this situation. Will it end the game, or will it wrap around?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement collision detection. You need to check if the snake's head collides with its own body or the walls of the grid. This will help you determine if the game should end."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to manage the food placement. When the snake eats food, you should randomly place a new piece of food in the grid, ensuring it doesn't appear on the snake's body."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the `move` method, ensure you update the snake's position correctly. You should add the new head position and remove the tail unless the snake has just eaten."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as moving in the opposite direction of the current movement. You may want to prevent the snake from reversing into itself."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the score. Each time the snake eats food, you should increase the score and return it as part of the move method's output."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your class structure is clear. You might want to separate the game logic from the display logic, which will help in testing and maintaining your code."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The grid dimensions are defined by the first parameter of the SnakeGame constructor.",
    "The snake's initial position must be unique and not overlap with food.",
    "The moves are represented by strings ('U', 'D', 'L', 'R') and should be processed in the order they are given.",
    "The game ends if the snake runs into itself or the walls, and you need to return -1 in that case."
