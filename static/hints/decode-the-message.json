      "content": "Remember that the `key` contains spaces which should not be included in the substitution mapping. Focus on the letters only."

    {
      "content": "As you build the substitution table, ensure that each letter from 'a' to 'z' is only mapped once. You can use a set to track letters that have already been added."

      "content": "When iterating through the `key`, maintain a counter for the letters in the alphabet. This will help you map the first unique letters to 'a', 'b', 'c', etc."

      "content": "After constructing the substitution table, think about how you will decode the `message`. You will need to replace each letter in the `message` with its corresponding letter from the substitution table."

      "content": "Don’t forget that spaces in the `message` should remain unchanged. Make sure your decoding logic accounts for this."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: the `key` will always contain at least one instance of each letter from 'a' to 'z'. This guarantees that your substitution table will be complete."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your output is formatted correctly. You should return the decoded message as a single string, with spaces preserved as they are in the `message`."
