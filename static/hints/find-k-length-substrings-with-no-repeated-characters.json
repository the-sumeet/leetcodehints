      "content": "Consider how you would extract substrings of length K from the input string. You can use a sliding window approach to help with this. For example, if your string is 'abcde' and K is 3, the substrings would be 'abc', 'bcd', and 'cde'."

      "content": "Think about how to check for repeated characters in a substring. A common way to do this is by using a set to track the characters you have seen. If you encounter a character that is already in the set, you know there is a repetition."
