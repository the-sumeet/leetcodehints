You need to categorize incomes into three groups: 'Low Salary' for incomes less than $20,000, 'Average Salary' for incomes between $20,000 and $50,000 (inclusive), and 'High Salary' for incomes greater than $50,000."

      "content": "Consider how you can count the number of accounts in each salary category. You might want to think about using conditional statements to filter the income values for each category."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to return all three categories in your result, even if some categories have a count of zero. This means you'll need to ensure that your query includes all categories regardless of the data in the Accounts table."

    {
      "content": "You can use a SQL `CASE` statement to help categorize the incomes. This allows you to define conditions for each salary category directly in your query."
