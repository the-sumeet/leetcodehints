      "content": "Start by understanding what a palindrome is. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, [1, 2, 1] is a palindrome, while [1, 2, 3] is not."

      "content": "Think about how you would check if a list is a palindrome. You can compare the first half of the list to the reversed second half. Consider using two pointers or a simple loop."
