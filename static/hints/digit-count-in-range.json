      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to count how many times a specific digit appears in all numbers within a given range. For example, for the range from 1 to 13, if you're counting the digit '1', you would find it in 1, 10, 11, 12, and 13."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the input format. You will receive three integers: the digit to count, the lower bound of the range, and the upper bound of the range. Make sure to handle these inputs correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the range of numbers. You might want to use a loop that goes from the lower bound to the upper bound, inclusive. Pseudocode: `for i in range(lower, upper + 1)`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through each number, you will need to convert it to a string to count occurrences of the digit. Remember that you can use the `str.count()` method in Python to count occurrences of a substring."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to how you handle the digit you are counting. It should also be converted to a string to match the format of the numbers you are iterating over."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the lower bound is greater than the upper bound. What should your function return in this case? Think about returning 0 or handling it gracefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where the digit is 0. For example, in the range from 1 to 100, how many times does '0' appear? This might require special attention to avoid counting leading zeros."

    {
      "content": "Think about performance. If the range is very large, iterating through every number could be inefficient. Consider if there are any mathematical properties or optimizations you can apply."

    {
      "content": "You might want to keep a running total of the digit counts as you iterate through the range. Initialize a counter variable before the loop and increment it based on the counts you find."

    {
      "content": "Consider testing your function with small ranges first, such as from 1 to 10 or 1 to 20, to ensure that your counting logic works correctly before scaling up."

    {
      "content": "After counting, ensure that your function returns the correct total count. This might involve returning the counter variable after the loop has completed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to validate your inputs. Ensure that the digit is between 0 and 9, and that the lower bound is less than or equal to the upper bound."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you will handle multiple test cases. You might want to encapsulate your counting logic in a function that can be called with different parameters."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the digit is not present in the range at all. What should your function return in this scenario? It should return 0."
