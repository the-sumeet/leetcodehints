    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will measure the distance. The distance is defined as `abs(i - start)`. Make sure you understand how the absolute value function works, especially when `i` is less than or greater than `start`."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the array is 0-indexed. This means that the first element of the array is at index 0. Be careful with your indexing when accessing elements of `nums`."

    {
      "content": "You can use a simple loop to traverse the array. For each index `i`, check if `nums[i]` equals `target`. If it does, calculate the distance from `start` and keep track of the minimum distance found."

      "content": "Think about how to store the minimum distance. You might want to initialize a variable to hold the smallest distance found so far. Update this variable whenever you find a smaller distance."

    {
      "content": "If there are multiple occurrences of `target` in `nums`, you need to ensure that you are correctly identifying the index that results in the smallest distance. This means you will need to compare distances for each occurrence."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, you might want to use a conditional statement to check if the current distance is less than the previously recorded minimum distance. If it is, update your minimum distance variable."

    {
      "content": "After you finish iterating through the array, return the minimum distance you have recorded. Ensure that your return statement is correctly formatted to match the expected output."

      "content": "To summarize your approach: Loop through `nums`, check for `target`, calculate the distance, and track the minimum distance. Make sure to return the final minimum distance at the end of your function."
