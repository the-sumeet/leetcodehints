      "content": "Focus on the `Confirmations` table. Each user can have multiple entries, and you need to categorize them based on the `action` column, either 'confirmed' or 'timeout'. Think about how you can count these actions for each user."

      "content": "Consider how to join the two tables. You want to ensure that you include all users from the `Signups` table, even those who have no entries in the `Confirmations` table. This is a classic case for a LEFT JOIN."
