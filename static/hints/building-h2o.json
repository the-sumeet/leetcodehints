      "content": "Start by understanding the basic structure of a water molecule: it consists of one oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms. This means that for every oxygen thread that passes through the barrier, there must be exactly two hydrogen threads that accompany it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can use synchronization mechanisms to control the flow of threads. You might want to use semaphores or condition variables to manage the waiting and signaling between hydrogen and oxygen threads."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to track the number of hydrogen and oxygen threads that are waiting to pass through the barrier. You will need to ensure that the conditions for forming a water molecule are met before allowing any threads to proceed."
    },
    {
      "content": "When an oxygen thread arrives at the barrier, it should check if there are at least two hydrogen threads present. If not, it should wait. Similarly, hydrogen threads should wait if there isn't an oxygen thread available to bond with."
    },
    {
      "content": "Use a shared counter to keep track of how many hydrogen and oxygen threads are currently at the barrier. You can increment this counter when a thread arrives and decrement it when a thread is released."
    },
    {
      "content": "Ensure that the release methods for hydrogen and oxygen threads are synchronized properly. You might want to use a mutex to protect access to shared resources, preventing race conditions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the order of threads might vary. For example, if all hydrogen threads arrive before any oxygen threads, how will you handle that situation? Make sure your logic can accommodate different sequences of input."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to implement the waiting logic. You may need to use condition variables to signal when a water molecule can be formed, allowing the waiting threads to proceed in groups of three."
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement the logic for releasing threads. After releasing one oxygen and two hydrogen threads, you should check if there are more threads waiting to form another molecule. If so, allow them to proceed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement. The total number of threads must always be a multiple of three, and the counts of hydrogen and oxygen must match the specified ratios."
