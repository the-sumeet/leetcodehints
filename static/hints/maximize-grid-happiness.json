      "content": "Consider the grid size and how people can be placed. The grid is m x n, and you can choose to place fewer people than you have available. Think about how to maximize happiness by strategically placing introverts and extroverts."

    {
      "content": "Remember that neighbors are only those directly adjacent (north, south, east, west). This means placing people in corners or edges of the grid can affect their happiness differently compared to placing them in the center."

      "content": "Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 for each neighbor. They thrive on having more neighbors, so placing them together can significantly increase their happiness. Think about clustering extroverts."
