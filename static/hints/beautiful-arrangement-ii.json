      "content": "A straightforward way to achieve `k` distinct differences is to create a pattern in your list. For example, if `k = 1`, all differences must be the same, which can be achieved by placing numbers in a simple increasing order."

      "content": "Try to visualize the list and the differences. For example, if you have `n = 5` and `k = 3`, think about how you can arrange the numbers to create three distinct absolute differences, possibly by manipulating the order of the largest and smallest numbers."
