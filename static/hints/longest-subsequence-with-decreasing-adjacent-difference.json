      "content": "Focus on the requirement for the absolute differences between consecutive elements. For a valid subsequence, the condition |seq[1] - seq[0]| >= |seq[2] - seq[1]| must hold, and so on. This means you need to track the differences as you build your subsequence."

      "content": "Consider how you might iterate through the array to form potential subsequences. You could use a nested loop to check pairs of elements and see if they can be part of the same subsequence based on the difference condition."

      "content": "Think about using dynamic programming to store the lengths of valid subsequences. Create an array, `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid subsequence ending at index `i`."

      "content": "When updating the `dp` array, ensure you are also keeping track of the last difference used in the subsequence. This will help you maintain the non-increasing order of differences."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the array is very small or contains duplicate values. How would these affect your subsequence? For instance, in an array like [10, 10, 10], the longest subsequence is just the same repeated number."
