      "content": "Since the number of points is limited (up to 50), you can afford to check all combinations of three points. Consider using a triple nested loop to generate these combinations."

      "content": "When calculating the area for each combination of points, keep track of the maximum area found so far. You can initialize a variable to store the maximum area and update it whenever you find a larger area."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where points may be collinear. In such cases, the area will be zero. However, since you are looking for the largest area, this will not affect your maximum calculation."

      "content": "To improve your solution, you might want to think about how to avoid redundant calculations. For instance, if you already calculated the area for a particular set of points, you donâ€™t need to recalculate it."

    {
      "content": "As you implement the area calculation, remember to use the absolute value function to ensure the area is non-negative, as the points might be arranged in different orders."
