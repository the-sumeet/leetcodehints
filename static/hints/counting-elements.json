      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to count the number of elements that are strictly greater than their preceding elements in the list. Think about how you would compare each element to the one before it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would iterate through the list. You might want to use a loop to go through each element, but remember that you can't start from the first element since it has no predecessor."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to keep track of your counts. You could initialize a counter variable to zero and increment it whenever you find an element that is greater than the one before it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases. What if the input list is empty or has only one element? Make sure your code can handle these scenarios without errors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the return value. You should return the count of elements that are greater than their predecessors, not the elements themselves. This is a crucial detail."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating, use an index variable that starts at 1, since you will be comparing each element to the one before it. For example, you can use a loop like `for i in range(1, len(nums)):`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of duplicate values. If two consecutive elements are equal, you should not increment your counter. Make sure your logic accounts for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to print or log intermediate counts during your loop to debug and ensure your logic is working as intended. This can help you catch any mistakes early."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your solution. A single pass through the list (O(n)) is likely sufficient for this problem. Make sure your solution is efficient."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, write a test case with various scenarios, including edge cases like an empty list, a list with one element, and a list where all elements are the same. This will help ensure your solution is robust."
