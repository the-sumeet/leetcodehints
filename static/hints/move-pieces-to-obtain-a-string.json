      "content": "When moving 'L' pieces, they can only move into '_' spaces directly to their left. Similarly, 'R' pieces can only move into '_' spaces directly to their right. This means that the relative order of 'L' and 'R' in both strings is crucial."

      "content": "As you compare the positions of 'L' and 'R', ensure that for every 'L' in `target`, there is a corresponding 'L' in `start` that can reach that position. The same goes for 'R'. Keep in mind the number of blank spaces available in between."
