      "content": "Consider how you can identify distinct values in the `x` array. You might want to use a data structure that allows you to keep track of unique values and their corresponding maximum `y` values."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to group the values in `x` by their distinct values. You can use a dictionary or a map where the key is the value from `x` and the value is a list of corresponding `y` values."

    {
      "content": "Once you have grouped the values, remember that you need to select the top `y` values for each distinct `x` value. This will help you maximize the sum of `y[i] + y[j] + y[k]`."

      "content": "Ensure you have at least three distinct values in `x`. If not, you should immediately return -1, as it's impossible to form a valid triplet."

      "content": "As you combine the `y` values, remember to check that they come from distinct `x` values. You can do this by maintaining a list of the distinct `x` values you are currently using."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where there may be ties in the `y` values. You should always prioritize the largest values, but ensure they come from distinct `x` values."
