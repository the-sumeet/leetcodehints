      "content": "Consider the case where x is greater than y. In this situation, you will likely need to decrement x or use division operations to reduce its value. What would be the quickest way to close the gap between x and y?"

      "content": "If x is less than y, you will need to increment x to reach y. However, think about whether you can use the division operations effectively to get closer to y before incrementing. Can you find a strategy that minimizes the total number of operations?"

    {
      "content": "When decrementing or incrementing, each operation counts as one step. However, division operations can significantly reduce the value of x in one step. How can you decide when to use these operations versus simple increments or decrements?"

      "content": "Think about the distance between x and y. If the difference is small, using increments or decrements might be sufficient. But if the difference is large, how can you leverage division to minimize the number of operations?"
