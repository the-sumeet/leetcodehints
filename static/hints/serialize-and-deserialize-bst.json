    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the tree as a string. You might want to use a preorder traversal for serialization, which processes the root node first, followed by the left subtree and then the right subtree. This order will help you reconstruct the tree later."

    {
      "content": "When serializing, think about how to represent null nodes. You can use a placeholder (like 'null' or a specific character) to indicate that a node does not exist. This will help maintain the structure during deserialization."
    },
    {
      "content": "For deserialization, you'll need to split the serialized string back into individual values. Consider how you will handle the placeholder for nulls during this process. You might use a queue or a stack to manage the nodes as you reconstruct the tree."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as an empty tree. An empty tree should serialize to a specific string (like '[]') and deserialize back to a null root. Think about how your algorithm will differentiate between an empty tree and a tree with nodes."

      "content": "As you implement the serialization function, keep track of the order in which you add nodes to the string. You can use a recursive function to traverse the tree and build the string incrementally."

      "content": "Make sure to test your implementation with various test cases, including edge cases like a single-node tree, a balanced tree, and a skewed tree. This will help ensure your solution is robust."
