    {
      "content": "Consider how the choice of action affects the number of oranges left. Eating 1 orange is straightforward, but the other two options can significantly reduce the number of oranges. Think about how to maximize the reduction in each step."

    {
      "content": "Think about the base case. If you have only 1 orange, how many days will it take to eat it? This can help you build your solution recursively or iteratively."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to consider using a recursive approach to explore all possible paths of eating oranges. However, be careful of overlapping subproblems, as the same number of oranges can be reached through different sequences of actions."

      "content": "To optimize your solution, consider using memoization to store results of previously computed states. This can help avoid recalculating the minimum days for the same number of oranges."

      "content": "Think about the constraints: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^9`. This indicates that your solution needs to be efficient. A simple recursive solution without optimization may lead to timeouts."

      "content": "Try to derive a formula or a pattern from smaller values of `n`. For example, if you manually calculate the minimum days for values from 1 to 10, you might notice a pattern that can help in generalizing your approach."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, remember to check which action to take based on the divisibility of `n`. You will need to compare the results of each possible action to find the minimum days."
