      "content": "Remember that a path crosses itself if you visit the same point more than once. This means you need to check if a newly calculated position already exists in your set of visited points."

      "content": "When you move in the four directions, the number of steps taken can vary. Make sure your logic accounts for varying distances in each direction."
