      "content": "Consider the problem as finding the number of non-negative integer solutions to the equation `x1 + x2 + x3 = n`, where `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` are the number of candies each child receives."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that each child can receive at most `limit` candies. This means you need to consider cases where the number of candies given to a child exceeds this limit."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can use combinatorial counting to solve this problem. The stars and bars theorem might be useful here, but you need to account for the limit constraint."

    {
      "content": "Try to break the problem down into cases based on the maximum number of candies any child can receive. For example, if one child receives `limit + 1` candies, how would that affect the remaining candies and children?"

      "content": "You might want to calculate the total number of unrestricted distributions first, and then subtract the cases where one or more children exceed the `limit`."

      "content": "You can express the number of ways to distribute candies using combinations. For instance, the number of ways to distribute `k` candies to `m` children is given by the formula `C(k + m - 1, m - 1)`."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when `n` is less than or equal to `3 * limit`. In such cases, all distributions are valid."
