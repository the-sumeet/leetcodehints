      "content": "Think about the implications of parity. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have different parities, you lose `x` points. This means that your strategy should consider not just maximizing the sum of visited values, but also minimizing penalties."

      "content": "Try to visualize the score calculation process. For example, if you visit positions 0, 2, and 4, calculate the score step by step, including any penalties for moving between positions with different parities."

      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where all numbers have the same parity. In such cases, you can visit all positions without incurring any penalties, which simplifies your score calculation."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `x` is larger than the values in the array. If moving to a position incurs a penalty greater than the score gained, it may be better to skip that position."

      "content": "As a final step, ensure you are returning the maximum score found after considering all possible paths through the array. You might want to keep track of the best score seen so far as you iterate."
