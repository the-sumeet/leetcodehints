      "content": "When a server handles a request, update its `end_time` to the current arrival time plus the load of the request. This will ensure you know when the server will be free next."

    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The number of servers `k` can be as large as 100,000, so your solution should be efficient, ideally O(n) where n is the number of requests."

      "content": "The arrival times and load times are both strictly positive integers and can be very large (up to 1 billion). Make sure your solution handles these values correctly without overflow."
