      "content": "Consider how to handle the extremely large integer represented by the array `b`. Instead of treating `b` as a single number, think about how you can compute `b mod (p-1)` where `p = 1337`. This is useful because of Fermat's Little Theorem."

    {
      "content": "Remember that for any integer `x`, `x^0 = 1`. This means if `b` is all zeros, the result should be 1 regardless of `a`. Think about how you can check for this condition early."

    {
      "content": "When calculating `b mod (p-1)`, you can process the digits of `b` as you would for converting a number from base 10 to base `p-1`. This means you can iterate through the array and build the modulus step by step."

      "content": "To compute `b mod (p-1)`, you can use the formula: `result = (result * 10 + b[i]) % (p-1)` as you iterate through the array. This will give you the effective exponent you need."
