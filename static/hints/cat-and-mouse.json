      "content": "Consider the implications of optimal play. Both the Mouse and the Cat will make moves that maximize their chances of winning. What strategies would each player employ to either escape or capture?"

    {
      "content": "Identify the end conditions of the game. The Cat wins if it occupies the same node as the Mouse, the Mouse wins if it reaches the Hole, and the game is a draw if a position is repeated with the same player's turn."

      "content": "Visualize the graph structure. Since the graph is undirected, each edge can be traversed in both directions. This can influence the movement options available to both players."

      "content": "Consider using a recursive approach with memoization to explore the game states. Each state can be represented by the current positions of the Mouse and Cat, as well as whose turn it is."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the draw condition. If a state has been visited before with the same player's turn, you should return a draw. You may want to use a set to track visited states."

      "content": "Consider the order of moves. The Mouse moves first, which gives it an initial advantage. How can you leverage this in your recursive exploration?"
