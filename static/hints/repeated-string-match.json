      "content": "Calculate the minimum number of times you would need to repeat `a` based on the length of `b`. You can start by dividing the length of `b` by the length of `a` to get a baseline number of repetitions."
    },
    {
      "content": "After calculating the baseline repetitions, remember to check if `b` can be a substring of the repeated version of `a`. You might need to repeat `a` one more time than your initial calculation to account for cases where `b` starts near the end of one repetition of `a`."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where `b` contains characters not present in `a`. If `b` has characters that don't exist in `a`, it's impossible for `b` to be a substring of any repetitions of `a`."

      "content": "When you repeat `a`, you can concatenate it in a loop until the length of the repeated string is at least as long as `b`. This will help you ensure you have enough characters to check against."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the repeated string, use a substring search method (like `in` in Python) to check if `b` is indeed a substring of the repeated `a`. Keep track of how many times you repeated `a`."

    {
      "content": "Finally, if you reach a point where the repeated string is longer than necessary but still doesn't contain `b`, return -1. This indicates that it's impossible for `b` to be a substring of any repetitions of `a`."
