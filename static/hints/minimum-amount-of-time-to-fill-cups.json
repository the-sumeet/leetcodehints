    {
      "content": "Consider how you can fill the cups. You can either fill 2 cups of different types in one second or 1 cup of any type. Think about how this affects your strategy for minimizing time."

      "content": "Try to visualize the process. If you have a scenario where one type of cup has a significantly higher amount than the others, how would you prioritize filling them?"
