    "The sentences can be of different lengths; if they are, return false immediately.",
    "Synonym pairs are bidirectional, meaning if one word is a synonym of another, the reverse is also true.",
    "Consider how to handle empty sentences; they may be similar if both are empty.",
    "The return value should be a boolean indicating whether the sentences are similar."
