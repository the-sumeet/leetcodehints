    {
      "content": "Remember that the function should return a Promise. This is crucial because the sleep function needs to resolve after a certain duration."

      "content": "To make the function wait for a specified amount of time, you will need to use a mechanism that allows for a delay. Consider using `setTimeout` as it is commonly used for such purposes."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using `setTimeout`, keep in mind that it takes two parameters: a callback function to execute after the delay and the delay time in milliseconds."
    },
    {
      "content": "You will need to wrap the `setTimeout` inside a Promise. This way, you can resolve the Promise when the timer completes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the input parameter correctly. The problem states that `millis` will always be a positive integer between 1 and 1000, so you don't need to handle negative cases."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider what value you want to resolve the Promise with. The problem states that it can resolve any value, so you can choose to resolve it with `undefined` or any other value."

      "content": "Think about how to test your function. You can use `Date.now()` to measure the elapsed time after calling your sleep function to ensure it behaves as expected."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that the actual sleep duration may vary slightly due to the nature of JavaScript's event loop and timers. Minor deviations from the specified `millis` are acceptable."
