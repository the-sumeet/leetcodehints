      "content": "Consider the operations allowed: you can increment any element of the array. Think about how you might need to adjust elements that are not in the correct order to achieve a strictly increasing sequence."

      "content": "Look at the relationship between consecutive elements. For any two elements nums[i] and nums[i+1], if nums[i] >= nums[i+1], you'll need to perform operations to make nums[i+1] greater than nums[i]."

      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. Since you are iterating through the array once, your solution should ideally run in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array."
