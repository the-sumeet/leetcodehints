      "content": "Think about how to represent the sequence of moves. You can represent the moves as a string composed of 'H's and 'V's, where the number of 'H's is equal to 'column' and the number of 'V's is equal to 'row'."

      "content": "To find the k-th lexicographically smallest instruction set, you need to generate all possible combinations of 'H' and 'V'. However, generating all combinations can be inefficient for larger inputs."
