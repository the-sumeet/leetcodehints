    },
    {
      "content": "Initialize the snake's starting position at the top-left corner of the matrix, which corresponds to index (0, 0) or simply the integer 0. Remember that the snake's movement will change this position based on the commands."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to interpret the commands. Each command corresponds to a movement in the matrix: 'UP' decreases the row index, 'DOWN' increases it, 'LEFT' decreases the column index, and 'RIGHT' increases it."

      "content": "To process the commands, you will need a loop. Iterate through each command in the `commands` array and update the snake's position based on the current command."

      "content": "After processing all commands, the final position of the snake can be calculated using the formula `position = (row * n) + column`. Ensure you are using the updated indices after all movements."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when the commands lead the snake to the edge of the grid. However, the problem guarantees that the snake will not go out of bounds, simplifying your checks."

      "content": "Consider writing helper functions to handle the movement logic. This can help keep your main function clean and focused on iterating through commands."

      "content": "You might want to print or log the position after each command to debug and ensure that the movements are being applied correctly. This can help you visualize the snake's path."
