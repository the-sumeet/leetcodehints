      "content": "If 'neededIncrease' is less than or equal to 0, check if the current distance is already equal to the target. If so, you can return the edges as is. If not, it's impossible to achieve the target."

      "content": "If 'neededIncrease' is positive, consider how many edges with -1 weights you have. The total weight you can assign to these edges must sum up to 'neededIncrease' to achieve the target distance."
