      "content": "Start by understanding the process described in the problem. You need to repeatedly create a new array from the existing one until only one element remains. Each element of the new array is derived from the sum of adjacent elements in the current array, taken modulo 10."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the size of the array changes with each iteration. The length of the new array is always one less than the current array. This means you will continue this process until the array has only one element left."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can implement the creation of the new array. You can use a loop to iterate through the original array and calculate the new values based on the formula provided: `newNums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the base case where the input array has only one element. In this case, you should return that element immediately as the triangular sum."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints given in the problem. The length of the array can be between 1 and 1000, and each element is a digit from 0 to 9. This means you won't have to deal with negative numbers or large integers."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, consider using a loop that continues until the length of the array is greater than 1. After each iteration, replace the original array with the new array you created."

    {
      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your solution. Since the maximum length of the array is 1000, a nested loop approach may still work, but you should aim for a solution that minimizes unnecessary computations."

    {
      "content": "Try to visualize the transformation of the array with an example. For instance, starting with [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], the first transformation would yield [3, 5, 7, 9]. Continue this process to see how the array evolves."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the input array has all identical elements. For example, if `nums = [7, 7, 7, 7]`, how would the process unfold? This can help you ensure your solution handles all scenarios."

    {
      "content": "You are very close to the solution! Implement the loop to create the new array and remember to return the final single element after the loop terminates. Make sure to test your implementation with various cases to validate correctness."
