      "content": "Consider how you can generate all possible substrings from a given string. You can use two nested loops: the outer loop for the starting index and the inner loop for the ending index. This will help you systematically explore all substrings."

    {
      "content": "Think about what it means for a substring to be divisible. You need to clarify what criteria you will use to determine if a substring is divisible. For example, are you checking if the numeric value of the substring is divisible by a specific number?"

      "content": "Before diving into the implementation, consider edge cases. What happens if the string is empty or consists of non-numeric characters? Make sure to handle these scenarios in your solution."

      "content": "When you generate substrings, remember to convert them to a number if you are checking for divisibility. You can use functions like `int()` in Python to convert a string to an integer."
