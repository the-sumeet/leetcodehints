      "content": "Consider how you would add two binary numbers. You typically start from the least significant bit and move to the most significant bit, carrying over when the sum exceeds the base. How might this change with negabinary?"

    {
      "content": "When adding two negabinary numbers, be aware of the carry. In negabinary, a carry can be either 0, 1, or -1, which means you need to adjust the current bit accordingly. Think about how you would handle a carry of -1."

      "content": "You might find it helpful to reverse the input arrays so you can work from the least significant bit first. After processing, you can reverse the result array back to the correct order."

      "content": "As you add the bits from both arrays, ensure you handle cases where one array is longer than the other. You will need to account for this when accessing the elements of each array."

      "content": "As you build the result array, it may be useful to use a temporary list to store the bits and then reverse it at the end. This way, you can easily manage the order of bits."
