      "content": "Think about how many changes you can make to transform 'F's into 'T's or vice versa. You can only change up to 'k' characters, so keep track of how many changes you have left."

      "content": "As you expand your window, count how many characters are not matching the desired character ('T' or 'F'). If this count exceeds 'k', you need to shrink the window from the left."
