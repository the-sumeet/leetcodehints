    {
      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to perform `k` operations on the `nums` array, where each operation involves finding the minimum value in the array and multiplying it by a given `multiplier`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that if there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, you should select the one that appears first in the array. This means you need to keep track of the index when searching for the minimum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will find the minimum value efficiently. You can iterate through the array to find the minimum value and its index. Think about how you will update the array after each operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "After identifying the minimum value and its index, you will replace that value with its product with the `multiplier`. Make sure to update the array correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since you need to perform this operation `k` times, think about using a loop that runs `k` iterations. Each iteration should include the steps to find the minimum and update the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints provided in the problem. For instance, the length of `nums` can be up to 100, and `k` can be up to 10. This means your approach should be efficient but can afford some simple operations due to the small limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `k` is larger than the number of unique elements in `nums`. How will your algorithm handle repeated minimum values in such scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the initial state of the array and how it changes with each operation. You might want to print or log the array after each operation to ensure your updates are correct."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to return the final state of the `nums` array after all `k` operations are completed. Ensure that your return statement is correctly formatted."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, try writing a simple version of your function that handles just one operation first. Once that works, you can expand it to handle multiple operations in a loop."
