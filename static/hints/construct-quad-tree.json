      "content": "Before diving into the recursion, consider how to check if a sub-grid is uniform. You can iterate through the elements of the sub-grid to see if they all have the same value."

    {
      "content": "When you find a uniform sub-grid, set the `isLeaf` property to `True` and the `val` property to the value of that sub-grid (either 0 or 1). This means you won't need to create children for this node."

    {
      "content": "If the sub-grid is not uniform, create a new node with `isLeaf` set to `False`. You can set the `val` to either 0 or 1; it doesn't affect the correctness of the Quad-Tree."

      "content": "When constructing the Quad-Tree, consider edge cases such as all 0's or all 1's in the grid. These should create a single leaf node instead of multiple nodes."

      "content": "After constructing the Quad-Tree, think about how to serialize it for output. The output format requires a level order traversal representation of the tree."
