      "content": "Start by understanding what it means for a graph to be bipartite. A bipartite graph can be colored using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the two sets A and B. One common approach is to use two colors (e.g., 0 and 1) to represent the two sets. You can use an array to store the color of each node."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can traverse the graph. A common method for graph traversal is using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Which method do you think would be easier for coloring the graph?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When you start coloring a node, you need to color all its adjacent nodes with the opposite color. Make sure to check if an adjacent node has already been colored. What will you do if you find a conflict in coloring?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Since the graph may not be connected, ensure that you initiate your traversal from every unvisited node in the graph. This will help you cover all components of the graph."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when the graph has only one node. How would you determine if a single-node graph is bipartite?"
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your traversal, keep track of the colors assigned to each node. If you ever attempt to color a node that has already been colored with the same color as its adjacent node, you can conclude that the graph is not bipartite."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to return the result. You should return true if you can color the graph without conflicts and false otherwise. Make sure to check the return conditions carefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your BFS or DFS, you might want to use a queue (for BFS) or a stack (for DFS). Think about how you will manage the nodes to visit next and how to update their colors."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution runs efficiently. Given the constraints, aim for a time complexity of O(n + m), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of edges."
