      "content": "Consider how you can check if a specific subarray from `groups` exists in `nums`. You might want to look for the first element of the subarray in `nums` and see if the subsequent elements match."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the subarrays must be disjoint. This means that the indices of the elements in `nums` for one subarray cannot overlap with those of another. Think about how you can keep track of the indices you have already used."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through `nums`, maintain a pointer or index that indicates where you are in the array. This will help you ensure that each subarray is found in order and does not overlap with previously found subarrays."

      "content": "You might want to use a loop to go through each group in `groups`. For each group, find its starting position in `nums`, and then check if the entire group matches the corresponding elements in `nums`."

      "content": "When you find a match for a group, update your index in `nums` to the end of the matched subarray. This ensures that the next group starts searching from the right position."

      "content": "Consider the time complexity of your approach. You want to ensure that your solution is efficient, especially since `nums` and `groups` can be quite large. Think about how many times you might iterate through `nums`."

    {
      "content": "You can use a helper function to check if a specific subarray from `groups` matches a segment of `nums`. This function can return a boolean indicating if the match is successful and update the index accordingly."
