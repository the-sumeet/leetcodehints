      "content": "Consider the positions of the infected people in the array. Each infected person can only infect their immediate left and right neighbors, provided they are uninfected."

      "content": "Think about the gaps between the infected positions. For example, if `sick = [0, 4]`, the uninfected positions are in the ranges [1, 2, 3]. How many uninfected people are there in each gap?"

    {
      "content": "Identify the segments of uninfected people between the infected ones. For `sick = [0, 4]`, the uninfected segment is from index 1 to index 3, which has 3 uninfected people."

    {
      "content": "Each segment of uninfected people can be infected in various orders. The number of valid sequences depends on how many uninfected people are in each segment and their adjacency to infected people."

    {
      "content": "Use combinatorial mathematics to calculate the number of ways to arrange the uninfected people in each segment. For a segment of length `k`, the number of ways to arrange them is `k!`."

    {
      "content": "Remember to account for the constraints. The first person to get infected must be adjacent to an infected person. This limits the choices for the first infection in each segment."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to combine the valid sequences from multiple segments. If you have multiple segments of uninfected people, the total valid sequences can be calculated using the product of the arrangements from each segment."

      "content": "Donâ€™t forget about the modulo operation. Since the result can be large, you need to return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to structure your final calculation. You will need to multiply the number of valid sequences from each segment and apply the modulo operation."
