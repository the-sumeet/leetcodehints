    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the order of characters in both strings. The characters in the source string must be used in the same order when forming the target string. This means that you can't rearrange the characters from the source string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can traverse through the target string while keeping track of your position in the source string. You might want to use two pointers: one for the target and one for the source."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you reach the end of the source string while trying to match the target, you will need to start over from the beginning of the source string. This is where repetition comes into play. How will you keep track of how many times you've used the source string?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the target string is empty or where the source string is empty. What should you return in those cases? Think about how these cases affect the overall logic of your solution."

      "content": "You may also want to think about the scenario where the source string does not contain all the characters needed to form the target string. How will you handle such cases? This could help you avoid unnecessary computations."

    {
      "content": "It might be useful to create a mapping of character frequencies in the source string. This can help you quickly determine if you can form certain parts of the target string. Consider how you will use this mapping in your logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the target string, keep a count of how many times you've completed the source string. This count will be crucial for your final answer. Think about how you will increment this count."
    },
    {
      "content": "You should also consider how to handle characters in the target string that do not appear in the source string at all. If a character is missing, you cannot form the target string, and you need to return an appropriate value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that you are returning the correct format for your answer. The answer should be the minimum number of times the source string needs to be repeated to form the target string. Think about how you will calculate and return this value."
