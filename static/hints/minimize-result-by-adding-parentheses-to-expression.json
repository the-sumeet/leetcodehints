      "content": "Think about how you can split the number before the '+' into two parts. For example, in '247+38', you can split '247' into '2' and '47'. This will allow you to create a new expression like '2(47+38)'."

      "content": "Make sure to format your output correctly. The parentheses should be placed directly around the '+' and you need to return the entire expression as a string."

    "The expression is of the form '<num1>+<num2>' with positive integers.",
    "There is exactly one '+' in the expression.",
    "The result after adding parentheses must fit within a signed 32-bit integer.",
    "If multiple configurations yield the same result, return any valid one.",
    "The output must be a string with parentheses placed correctly around the '+' sign."
