      "content": "Next, you'll need to count how many times each digit appears in the string. You can use a dictionary or an array to store the counts for each digit from '1' to '9'. This will help you verify the second condition for a valid pair."

      "content": "When counting the digits, remember that the digit '1' should be counted as one, '2' as two, and so on. This means that the count for each digit should match its numeric value."
