    {
      "content": "Consider the edge cases where `i - k` or `i + k` might be out of bounds. Elements at the boundaries of the array should be handled carefully, as they may not have both neighbors."

      "content": "You can iterate through the array using a loop. For each element, check if it qualifies as good by comparing it with its neighbors at the specified indices."

      "content": "Remember to check the bounds of the array when accessing `nums[i - k]` and `nums[i + k]`. You can use conditional statements to ensure you do not access an index that is out of range."

      "content": "You might want to use a helper function to check if an index is valid before comparing the values. This can make your main logic cleaner and easier to read."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that you return the sum of all good numbers after the loop completes. The return statement should simply be `return sum;` where `sum` is your accumulated total."
