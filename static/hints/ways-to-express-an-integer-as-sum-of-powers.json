      "content": "Consider the base case where `n` is small. For instance, if `n = 1` and `x = 1`, how many unique integers can you use? This will help you think about the problem in simpler terms."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to generate the unique integers that can be used. You can start by calculating the maximum integer `k` such that `k^x` is less than or equal to `n`. This will give you a range of integers to work with."

      "content": "You might want to use a recursive approach to explore all combinations of unique integers. As you explore, keep track of the current sum and the integers used so far to ensure uniqueness."
