    {
      "content": "Consider how you can efficiently find the maximum beauty for multiple queries. A brute force approach would involve checking all items for each query, which can be inefficient for large inputs."

      "content": "Think about sorting the items based on price. This will allow you to quickly determine which items fall within the price limit of each query. How would you organize the items after sorting?"

    {
      "content": "Once the items are sorted by price, you can create a new array that keeps track of the maximum beauty seen so far as you iterate through the sorted items. This way, for any price, you can easily find the maximum beauty of items that are affordable."

      "content": "When processing each query, you can use binary search to find the position in the sorted items where the price exceeds the query value. This will help you quickly locate the relevant items."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all items are too expensive for the lowest query or when multiple items have the same price but different beauty values. Make sure your solution accounts for these scenarios."

    {
      "content": "As you build your solution, ensure that you maintain the original order of queries when returning the results. You might want to store the results in a separate array indexed by the original query indices."

      "content": "After implementing the sorting and maximum beauty tracking, think about the overall time complexity of your solution. Aim for a solution that is efficient enough to handle the upper limits of the input constraints."
