    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to iterate over both arrays. You will need a nested loop: one loop for `nums1` and another for `nums2`. This will allow you to check each possible pair (i, j)."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to check if one number is divisible by another. You can use the modulus operator `%`. For example, `if (nums1[i] % (nums2[j] * k) == 0)` will check if `nums1[i]` is divisible by `nums2[j] * k`."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. Both `nums1` and `nums2` can have lengths up to 50, and their elements can also be as large as 50. This means your solution should be efficient but does not need to be overly optimized."
