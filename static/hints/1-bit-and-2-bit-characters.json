      "content": "Consider how the characters are represented: a one-bit character is represented by '0', while two-bit characters are represented by '10' or '11'. This distinction is crucial for decoding the array."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, keep track of the index. If you encounter a '0', it indicates a one-bit character. If you encounter a '1', you need to check the next bit to determine if it forms a two-bit character."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the last character. Since the array ends with a '0', check how many bits you can decode before reaching the end. This will help you determine if the last character is one-bit."
