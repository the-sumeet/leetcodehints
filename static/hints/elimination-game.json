      "content": "The first step of the algorithm involves removing the first number and then every other number from the list. Make sure to visualize how this affects the list. For instance, after the first pass with n = 9, the list becomes [2, 4, 6, 8]."

      "content": "Remember that after each pass, you alternate the direction of removal. After removing from left to right, the next pass will be from right to left. This is crucial for understanding the pattern."

      "content": "To simplify the problem, think about how the size of the list changes after each pass. You can observe that the number of elements is halved (or close to halved) after each complete round of removals."
