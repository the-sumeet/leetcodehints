      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find the smallest substring in the first string that contains all characters of the second string in the same order, but not necessarily consecutively."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can check if a substring contains the characters of the second string in order. You might want to use a two-pointer technique or a sliding window approach."

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently search for the characters of the second string within the first string. You can iterate through the first string while maintaining an index for the second string."

      "content": "When you find a valid substring, check if it is smaller than any previously found valid substring. You will need to update your result accordingly."

      "content": "It's important to handle cases where multiple substrings are of the same minimum length. You should return the first one you find."

      "content": "Consider using a hashmap or an array to count occurrences of characters in the second string. This can help you verify if a substring contains all required characters."

      "content": "As you iterate through the first string, keep a count of how many characters from the second string you have matched. This will help you know when you have a valid substring."
