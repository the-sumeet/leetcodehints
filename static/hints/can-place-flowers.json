      "content": "Remember the main rule: no two flowers can be planted in adjacent plots. This means that if you plant a flower in a plot, the plots directly next to it cannot be used for planting."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the flowerbed is at the beginning or end of the array. You will need to check if the first or last plot is empty and if it can accommodate a flower."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the flowerbed array. You might want to use a loop to check each plot one by one and decide whether to plant a flower there."

    {
      "content": "When checking a plot to plant a flower, ensure you also check the adjacent plots. For example, if you are at index `i`, check `flowerbed[i-1]` (if `i > 0`) and `flowerbed[i+1]` (if `i < flowerbed.length - 1`)."

      "content": "As you iterate, keep a count of how many flowers you have successfully planted. If this count reaches `n`, you can immediately return true."

      "content": "Consider initializing a variable to count how many flowers you can plant, and update this variable every time you successfully plant a flower."

    {
      "content": "Think about the return condition. If you finish iterating through the flowerbed and your count of planted flowers is at least `n`, return true; otherwise, return false."
