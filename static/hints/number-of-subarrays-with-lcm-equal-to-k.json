      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the LCM of a subarray. You can use the relationship between LCM and the greatest common divisor (GCD): LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b). This will be useful for calculating the LCM iteratively."

      "content": "Think about how to iterate through all possible subarrays. You can use a nested loop where the outer loop picks the starting index and the inner loop picks the ending index of the subarray."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: both nums[i] and k are between 1 and 1000. This means that the LCM will also be manageable in size, but you should still handle cases where the LCM might exceed k."
