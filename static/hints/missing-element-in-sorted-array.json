      "content": "Start by understanding the properties of a sorted array. Since the array is sorted, the elements are in increasing order. This means that if a number is missing, it will be located between two existing numbers."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the missing element affects the sequence of numbers. For example, if you have an array like [4, 7, 9, 10], think about the numbers that could logically fit between the existing elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to identify the position where the missing element should be. You might want to use a loop to iterate through the array and check the difference between consecutive elements."

    {
      "content": "What if the missing element is less than the smallest number in the array? Make sure to handle this edge case by considering the range of possible values for the missing element."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem may ask for the k-th missing element. This means you need to track how many elements are missing as you traverse the array. You can maintain a counter for this purpose."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the array, check the difference between the current element and the previous one. If the difference is greater than 1, it indicates that there are missing elements between them."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you find missing elements, increment your counter until it reaches k. You need to ensure that you stop at the k-th missing element, not just any missing element."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider what happens when you reach the end of the array but still haven't found k missing elements. You may need to calculate the missing elements that would come after the last element in the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where k is larger than the number of missing elements found in the array. You might need to use the last element of the array to continue counting missing elements beyond it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the missing element. You will likely want to return the value of the k-th missing element as an integer, so ensure your logic leads you to that specific value."

    "The input array is guaranteed to be sorted in increasing order.",
    "The missing elements are defined as those that would fit into the array if it were complete.",
    "The value of k can be any positive integer, so be prepared for cases where k is larger than the number of missing elements in the array."
