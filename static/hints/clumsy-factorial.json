    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle the operations in the correct order. Since multiplication and division take precedence over addition and subtraction, you will need to perform those operations first before moving on to the addition and subtraction."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the operations. You might want to use a list or an array to store the integers from n down to 1, and then apply the operations in sequence based on their order."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the operations, remember that division is floor division. This means you should use integer division to ensure the result is an integer. For example, in Python, you can use '//' for floor division."

    {
      "content": "When applying the operations, keep track of the current result as you iterate through the numbers. You can use a variable to store the intermediate result after each operation."

      "content": "To manage the operations, consider using a loop that iterates through the numbers while also keeping track of which operation to apply next. You can use the modulo operator to cycle through the operations."

      "content": "Be cautious with edge cases. For example, when n is 1, the clumsy factorial should simply return 1, as there are no operations to perform."

      "content": "When you reach the end of your sequence, make sure to finalize your result correctly. You should have applied all operations in the correct order to get the final clumsy factorial value."

    {
      "content": "Consider testing your implementation with small values of n, such as 2, 3, and 4, to ensure that your logic for the operations is working correctly before scaling up to larger values."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your implementation handles larger values of n efficiently. Think about how you can optimize your calculations if necessary, especially since n can go up to 10,000."
