    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the string is 1-indexed. This means the first character has an index of 1, the second character has an index of 2, and so on. Make sure to account for this when calculating the product of the character's position and its index."

    {
      "content": "To compute the reverse degree, you will need to iterate through each character in the string. For each character, calculate both its reversed alphabet position and its 1-indexed position in the string."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the string, maintain a running total for the reverse degree. Initialize a variable to store this total before the loop starts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to access the index of each character in the string. You can use a simple loop with an index variable, or you can use Python's `enumerate()` function to get both the index and the character in one go."

      "content": "When calculating the product for each character, ensure you multiply the reversed alphabet position by its corresponding index. This is crucial for getting the correct contribution of each character to the total."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as strings that consist of the same character repeated multiple times. For instance, how would 'aaaa' be handled? Make sure your logic works for all possible valid inputs."

      "content": "After calculating the total for all characters, you will return this total as the output. Make sure your function has the correct return statement at the end."

    {
      "content": "Don't forget to test your function with various inputs, including strings of maximum length (1000 characters) and strings with only one character, to ensure it handles all cases efficiently."

      "content": "Finally, remember to check if your implementation is efficient enough given the constraints. A single loop through the string should suffice, keeping your time complexity at O(n)."
