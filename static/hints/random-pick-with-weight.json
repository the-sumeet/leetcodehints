      "content": "Start by understanding the input array `w`. Each element represents the weight associated with its index. The goal is to pick an index based on these weights, meaning higher weights should have a higher chance of being selected."

      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the total weight. The sum of all weights will be crucial in determining the probability of selecting each index. You can use a simple loop to sum the weights."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the cumulative weights. For each index `i`, you can create an array where each element at index `i` represents the sum of weights from index 0 to `i`. This will help in determining ranges for random selection."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the cumulative weights can be thought of as defining ranges for each index. For example, if `w = [1, 3]`, the cumulative weights would be `[1, 4]`. This means index 0 corresponds to the range [0, 1) and index 1 corresponds to [1, 4)."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the `pickIndex` function, consider using a random number generator to select a number between 0 and the total weight. This number will help you determine which index to return based on the cumulative weights."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the weights array has only one element. In this case, you should always return 0 since that is the only valid index."

    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints provided in the problem. The weights can be large, and the number of times `pickIndex` can be called is limited. Ensure your solution is efficient to handle the maximum constraints."

      "content": "Take note of the return format: your function should return an integer index. Ensure that your random selection logic consistently adheres to the defined probabilities."
