      "content": "Consider how many pairs you can form from the array. Since `n` is even, you can form `n/2` pairs. For each pair, you need to ensure their sum can be adjusted to a common target sum."

      "content": "Think about the possible sums that can be formed with the elements in `nums`. The minimum sum of a pair is `2` (1 + 1) and the maximum is `2 * limit`. This gives you a range of possible target sums to consider."
