      "content": "Start by understanding the initial state of the permutation. For any even integer n, the initial permutation is simply `perm = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. This is crucial as it sets the baseline for your operations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Take a closer look at the operation defined in the problem. You create a new array `arr` based on the current `perm`. Specifically, the elements at even indices come from the first half of `perm`, while those at odd indices come from the second half."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to manually simulate the operation for small values of n, such as 2 and 4. For instance, for n = 4, after one operation, `perm` transforms from `[0, 1, 2, 3]` to `[0, 2, 1, 3]`. This will help you visualize how the permutation changes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that the operation effectively shuffles the indices of the permutation. Think about how many times you need to apply this operation before the permutation returns to its original state."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the indices of the permutation as a cycle. Each operation rearranges the indices, and you can analyze how many operations it takes for each index to return to its original position."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on the cycle lengths created by the operations. For example, when n = 4, the cycles formed are (1, 2) and (0, 3). Understanding the cycle structure will help you determine the number of operations needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the relationship between the number of operations and the size of the permutation. The number of operations may depend on how the indices are grouped in cycles, especially since n is always even."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a mathematical approach to find the least common multiple (LCM) of the cycle lengths to determine how many operations are needed to return to the original permutation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the output should be the minimum non-zero number of operations. Ensure that your logic accounts for the case where the permutation might return to its original state in fewer operations than expected."
    },
    {
      "content": "As a final step, outline your approach in pseudocode. Consider how you will track the cycles and calculate the number of operations based on the cycle lengths. This will guide you to the final implementation."
