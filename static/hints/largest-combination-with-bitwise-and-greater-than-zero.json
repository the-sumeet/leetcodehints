    {
      "content": "Consider how the bitwise AND behaves with multiple numbers. The result will only have bits set to 1 where all numbers in the combination have those bits set to 1. This means that if you're looking for a combination with a non-zero AND, all selected numbers must share at least one common bit."

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find combinations of numbers. Instead of generating all possible combinations, consider focusing on the bits of each number. For each bit position, count how many numbers have that bit set."

      "content": "Create a frequency count for each bit position (from 0 to 30, since numbers can go up to 10^7). For each number in the candidates, check which bits are set and update your counts accordingly."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the maximum size of a valid combination corresponds to the maximum count of numbers that share a common bit. For example, if 4 numbers have the 3rd bit set, then the largest combination with a non-zero AND that includes that bit can be of size 4."

      "content": "When counting how many candidates have a specific bit set, remember to use bitwise operations. For example, to check if the k-th bit is set in a number `num`, use `num & (1 << k) != 0`."
