      "content": "You need to check if every element in the subarray is greater than a certain value. This value is calculated as threshold / k. Make sure to handle integer division correctly."

      "content": "To find the subarray, you can use a sliding window approach. This means you will maintain a window of size k and slide it across the array to check each subarray."
