      "content": "Consider how multiplying an element by 2 affects its binary representation. Multiplying by 2 shifts the bits to the left, which can potentially increase the OR result significantly if you choose the right element."

      "content": "Remember that multiplying an element by 2 multiple times can be treated as multiplying it by `2^m` where `m` is the number of times you multiply. This can help you calculate the new value directly."
