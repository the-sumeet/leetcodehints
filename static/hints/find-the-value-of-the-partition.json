      "content": "Think about the implications of sorting. Once the array is sorted, the maximum of nums1 will be the last element of nums1, and the minimum of nums2 will be the first element of nums2 if you choose a split point."

      "content": "Identify potential split points in the sorted array. If the array is sorted as [a1, a2, ..., an], valid split points are between elements, meaning you can split after any element except the last one."

      "content": "When you choose a split point at index i in the sorted array, nums1 will contain elements from index 0 to i, and nums2 will contain elements from index i+1 to the end. This ensures both arrays are non-empty."
