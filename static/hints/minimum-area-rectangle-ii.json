      "content": "Remember that the sides of the rectangle do not have to be parallel to the axes. This means that you will need to consider the orientation of the rectangle when calculating its area."

      "content": "To form a rectangle, you need to find pairs of points that can serve as opposite corners. Think about how you can determine if two points can be diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle."

      "content": "For any two points, if they are opposite corners of a rectangle, the other two corners can be derived using vector mathematics. Consider how to calculate the other two corners based on the midpoint and the direction vector."
