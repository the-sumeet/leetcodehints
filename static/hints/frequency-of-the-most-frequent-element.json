      "content": "Consider how you can utilize the allowed `k` operations. The goal is to make as many elements equal to the most frequently occurring element as possible. Think about how many increments are needed to turn one element into another."

      "content": "Sort the array first. Sorting can help you easily identify the closest elements to increment and can simplify the calculation of the number of operations needed to equalize elements."

      "content": "As you iterate through the sorted array, consider using a sliding window approach. This will allow you to efficiently calculate how many increments are needed to make all elements in the current window equal to the rightmost element of the window."

      "content": "When using the sliding window, maintain a running sum of the elements in the current window. This will help you quickly calculate the total number of increments required to make all elements in the window equal to the maximum element in that window."
