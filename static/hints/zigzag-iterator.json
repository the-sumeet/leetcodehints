    {
      "content": "Consider how you will keep track of your position in both lists. You might need two indices or pointers, one for each list, to know which element to return next."

      "content": "Think about how to handle cases where the lists are of different lengths. What should happen when one list runs out of elements while the other still has some left?"

    {
      "content": "You can use a loop to iterate through the lists. However, you need to ensure that you check the bounds of each list before accessing an element to avoid index errors."

    {
      "content": "An effective way to alternate between the two lists is to use a flag or a simple condition that checks which list to pull from next. For instance, you could use a boolean variable that toggles between true and false."

      "content": "When implementing the iterator, consider how you will handle the initialization and the end condition. You might want to define a method to check if there are more elements to iterate over."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when one or both lists are empty. Your iterator should still function correctly in these scenarios."

      "content": "Consider using a queue or a list to store the elements temporarily if you want to manage the order of elements more easily. This could simplify the logic of alternating between the two lists."

      "content": "Finally, ensure your implementation adheres to the expected output format. The iterator should return elements in the correct order, and you need to handle the end of iteration gracefully."
