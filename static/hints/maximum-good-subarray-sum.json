      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to find potential starting points for good subarrays. You might want to consider each element as a potential starting point and then look for a corresponding ending element that satisfies the good subarray condition."

      "content": "When you find a valid pair (i, j) such that |nums[i] - nums[j]| = k, remember to calculate the sum of the subarray from index i to j. You can use a simple loop to sum the elements in this range."
