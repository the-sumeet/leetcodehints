      "content": "Start by understanding what the Bitwise OR operation does. It compares each bit of two integers and returns a new integer where each bit is set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can apply the Bitwise OR operation to adjacent elements in the array. For example, for an array `arr`, you would need to look at `arr[i]` and `arr[i+1]` for each valid index `i`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the array. You will need a loop that goes from the first element to the second-to-last element since you will be accessing the next element in each iteration."

      "content": "Remember that the result of the Bitwise OR operation should be stored in a new list or array. Make sure to initialize this list before you start your loop."

      "content": "As you perform the Bitwise OR operation, consider how to append the results to your result list. You can use a method like `append()` to add each result after computing it."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to test your function with different cases, including arrays with duplicate values, all zeros, or all ones. This will help ensure your implementation is robust."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the loop to calculate the Bitwise OR for each adjacent pair and store the results. The final step will look something like this: for each `i` from `0` to `len(arr) - 2`, compute `arr[i] | arr[i + 1]` and store it."
