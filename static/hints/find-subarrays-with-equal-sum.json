      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the sum of each subarray of length 2. For an array `nums`, the sum of the subarray starting at index `i` can be calculated as `nums[i] + nums[i+1]`."

      "content": "Think about the constraints of the problem. You need to check if there are two subarrays of length 2 that have the same sum, and they must start at different indices."

      "content": "You can use a loop to iterate through the array and calculate the sum for each subarray of length 2. Remember that you can only go up to `len(nums) - 2` to avoid going out of bounds."
