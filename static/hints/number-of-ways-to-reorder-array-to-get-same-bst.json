    {
      "content": "Consider how the structure of the BST is determined by the order of insertion. For example, in the array [2,1,3], 2 becomes the root, 1 goes to the left, and 3 goes to the right."

      "content": "Think about the properties of BSTs: for any node, all values in the left subtree are smaller, and all values in the right subtree are larger. This will help you understand how to group elements."

      "content": "When reordering the array, the relative positions of elements that belong to the left and right subtrees of each node must remain unchanged to maintain the same BST structure."

    {
      "content": "To find the number of valid reorderings, you can use combinatorial counting. Specifically, if you know how many elements belong to the left and right subtrees, you can calculate the number of ways to interleave these elements."

      "content": "Use the binomial coefficient to calculate the number of ways to choose positions for elements in the left subtree from the total elements being considered. This is crucial for counting reorderings."

      "content": "Remember that the binomial coefficient C(n, k) can be calculated as n! / (k! * (n-k)!). You will need to compute factorials and their modular inverses for efficiency."
