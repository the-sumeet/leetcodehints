    {
      "content": "Remember that the last element of `derived` is a bit different. It wraps around and is calculated as `derived[n - 1] = original[n - 1] ⊕ original[0]`. This means that the first and last elements of `original` are directly linked."

    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the XOR operation: `a ⊕ a = 0` and `a ⊕ 0 = a`. This property can help you deduce values in the `original` array if you know some of its elements."

    {
      "content": "Try to derive the values of `original` from the `derived` array. Start by assuming a value for `original[0]`, and use the `derived` values to compute the rest of the elements. This will help you see if the values lead to a consistent solution."

    {
      "content": "Since the values in `original` must be binary (0 or 1), keep track of the values you derive. If you find a contradiction (like needing a value to be both 0 and 1), then it's impossible to form a valid `original` array."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the length of `derived` is 1. In this case, `derived[0]` must equal `original[0] ⊕ original[0]`, which is always 0. This means the only valid `derived` array of length 1 is [0]."

    {
      "content": "For longer arrays, observe patterns in the `derived` array. If `derived` has an even number of 1s, it might suggest a valid configuration of `original`, while an odd number of 1s could indicate issues."

    {
      "content": "Check the total number of 1s in the `derived` array. If the count of 1s is odd, it can lead to inconsistencies when trying to form pairs from `original`. This is a critical observation for determining validity."
