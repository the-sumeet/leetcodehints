    {
      "content": "Consider how to generate powers of x and y. You can use a loop to calculate x^i and y^j. Remember that you only need to compute these powers while they are less than or equal to the bound."

    {
      "content": "Think about the range of values for i and j. Since x and y can be as large as 100, you should determine how many times you can multiply before exceeding the bound. For example, if x = 2 and bound = 10, how many times can you multiply 2?"

    {
      "content": "Consider using a set to store the results. This will help you automatically handle duplicates since a powerful integer may be generated in multiple ways (e.g., x^2 + y^1 and x^1 + y^2 might yield the same result)."

      "content": "When generating powers of x and y, make sure to check if the current sum (x^i + y^j) exceeds the bound before adding it to your set of results. This will help you avoid unnecessary calculations."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when either x or y is 1. In such cases, the powers will not grow, and you should ensure your logic accounts for this to avoid infinite loops."
