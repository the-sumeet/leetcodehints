      "content": "Consider how you can represent each character in the word. You will need to decide whether to keep the character as is or to abbreviate it. Think about how you can use recursion or backtracking to explore all possibilities."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where you choose to abbreviate a sequence of characters. You will need to keep track of the count of abbreviated characters. For example, if you abbreviate 'o' and 'r' in 'word', you should track that as 'w2d'."

      "content": "Remember that you can have multiple ways to abbreviate the same word. For instance, 'word' can be abbreviated to 'w3d', 'wo2d', or even 'w1o1d'. Make sure your solution can generate all unique abbreviations."

      "content": "Consider the base case for your recursive function. What should happen when you reach the end of the word? You will need to add the current abbreviation to your results list."
