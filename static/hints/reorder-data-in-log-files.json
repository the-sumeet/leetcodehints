      "content": "When you extract the letter-logs, remember that they need to be sorted. The sorting criteria is first based on the contents of the log (everything after the identifier), and if those are the same, then by the identifier itself."

    {
      "content": "To sort the letter-logs, you can use a custom sorting function. This function should return a tuple where the first element is the content of the log and the second element is the identifier. This will ensure that Python's built-in sort handles the tie-breaking correctly."

    {
      "content": "Don't forget that the digit-logs should maintain their original relative order. This means that once you separate the logs, you should not sort the digit-logs at all; they should remain in the order they were found."

      "content": "When implementing the sorting, ensure that you are not modifying the original logs. Instead, create new lists for the sorted letter-logs and the preserved digit-logs. This will help you avoid unintended side effects."
