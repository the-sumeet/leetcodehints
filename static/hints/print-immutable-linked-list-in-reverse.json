      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of an immutable linked list. Each node typically consists of a value and a reference to the next node. Make sure you can traverse the list to access each node's value."

      "content": "Consider how you would normally print a linked list in order. What changes when you need to print it in reverse? Think about how you can either use recursion or a stack to help with this."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you choose to use recursion, remember that each function call can be thought of as pushing the current node onto a call stack. When the base case is reached (e.g., when the node is null), you can start printing the values as the stack unwinds."
    },
    {
      "content": "If using a stack, you would iterate through the linked list, pushing each node's value onto the stack. Then, you can pop values off the stack to print them in reverse order."

      "content": "Think about the edge cases. What happens if the linked list is empty? Ensure your solution can handle this scenario gracefully without errors."

      "content": "When implementing your solution, ensure that you are not modifying the original linked list since it is immutable. This means you should not change the next pointers of any nodes."

      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases like a single node, an empty list, and lists with negative numbers or duplicates to ensure robustness."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, remember to focus on the output format. You should print the values in reverse order, but consider how you want to separate them (e.g., spaces, commas)."
    },

      "content": "Finally, think about how you would structure your main function to call your reverse printing function. You may want to create a helper function that takes the head of the linked list as an argument."
