      "content": "Consider how to store the requests. A list or queue can be useful for maintaining the order of requests as they come in. Think about how you can efficiently add new requests."

      "content": "When a new request is added with the ping method, you need to count how many requests fall within the range [t - 3000, t]. This means you will need to check each request's timestamp."

    {
      "content": "Since the input guarantees that each ping will have a strictly increasing value of t, you can optimize your search for the valid requests by removing old requests that are no longer within the time frame."

      "content": "You might want to use a while loop to remove requests from the queue that are older than t - 3000. This will help maintain the correct state of your RecentCounter."

      "content": "Finally, your ping method should look something like this: after adding the new request, count the valid requests and return that count. Make sure your logic is clear and efficient."
