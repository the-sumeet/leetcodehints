      "content": "Remember that the first two operations are fixed: the first element goes to arr1 and the second to arr2. This means you can initialize arr1 and arr2 with the first two elements of nums."

      "content": "For subsequent operations (from the third element onward), you need to compare the last elements of arr1 and arr2. This comparison will dictate which array receives the next element from nums."

      "content": "When comparing the last elements of arr1 and arr2, think about how to access the last element. In Python, for example, you can use negative indexing: arr1[-1] gives you the last element of arr1."

      "content": "Think about how you will implement the loop for processing the elements of nums after the first two. You can use a for loop that starts at index 2 (the third element) and goes to the end of the nums array."
