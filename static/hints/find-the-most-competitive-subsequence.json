    {
      "content": "Think about the definition of 'most competitive'. You need to compare subsequences based on their elements' values at the first position where they differ. This means you should focus on the smallest possible elements for each position in your result."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can maintain the order of elements while selecting the most competitive subsequence. You might want to use a stack or a similar data structure to help keep track of your current subsequence."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through the array, think about how you can decide whether to include or exclude an element based on the current size of your subsequence and the remaining elements needed to reach size k."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you can only include an element if there are enough remaining elements in the array to reach the desired size k. This is crucial for ensuring you don't miss out on potential smaller elements."

      "content": "As you build your subsequence, consider using a greedy approach. If the current element is smaller than the last element in your subsequence and you can still reach size k, you might want to pop the last element."

      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where you might have to skip elements to maintain the competitive nature of your subsequence. This means being willing to discard larger elements for smaller ones when possible."

      "content": "Once you have your subsequence, ensure it is exactly of size k. If you have more than k elements, you may need to trim it down, but if you have fewer, you need to reconsider your selection strategy."
