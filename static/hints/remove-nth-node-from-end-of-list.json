      "content": "Think about how you can determine the position of the node to remove. Since you need to remove the nth node from the end, consider how you can find the length of the list first."

      "content": "Instead of calculating the length of the list first, consider using two pointers. One pointer can traverse the list normally, while the second pointer starts n steps ahead. This way, when the first pointer reaches the end, the second pointer will be at the node just before the one you want to remove."

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when the list has only one node or when n equals the length of the list. In these cases, you may need to adjust how you handle the head of the list."
