      "content": "Consider how you can represent the dislikes as an adjacency list. This will help you visualize which nodes (people) are connected (dislike each other). For example, if dislikes = [[1,2],[1,3]], then person 1 dislikes both 2 and 3."

      "content": "Think about how to traverse the graph. You can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the graph. During traversal, try to assign colors to each node and check for conflicts."

    {
      "content": "When assigning colors, remember that if you color one node with color A, all its neighbors should be colored with color B. If you encounter a neighbor that has the same color as the current node, then it's impossible to split them into two groups."

      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints. With n being up to 2000 and dislikes length up to 104, ensure your algorithm is efficient. A BFS or DFS approach with O(n + m) complexity (where m is the number of dislikes) is suitable."

      "content": "When implementing your coloring logic, you might want to use a simple array where index represents the person and the value represents their color (e.g., -1 for uncolored, 0 for color A, 1 for color B)."

      "content": "Remember to initiate a new DFS/BFS from any unvisited node, as the graph can be disconnected. Each disconnected component needs to be checked separately to ensure all nodes can be colored correctly."
