      "content": "Start by understanding what a duplicated substring is. A duplicated substring is a contiguous sequence of characters that appears more than once in the string. For example, in 'banana', 'ana' is a duplicated substring."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. The string length can be between 2 and 30,000 characters, and it only consists of lowercase English letters. This means your solution needs to be efficient, ideally better than O(n^2)."

      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently find substrings. One approach is to use a sliding window technique to generate all possible substrings of varying lengths."

    {
      "content": "Remember that overlapping substrings count as duplicates. For instance, in 'aaaa', the substring 'aa' appears multiple times even though they overlap."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to use a data structure to keep track of the substrings you have seen. A hash set or a dictionary could be useful to store these substrings and check for duplicates."

      "content": "Consider using binary search to optimize the process of finding the longest duplicated substring. You can search for the length of the substring and check for duplicates of that length."

      "content": "When checking for duplicates, you can use a rolling hash technique to compute hash values for substrings efficiently. This helps in quickly comparing substrings without needing to compare them character by character."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where no duplicated substring exists. You should return an empty string in this case. Make sure your function can handle this edge case."

    {
      "content": "Remember to consider the return format. The problem states you can return any duplicated substring with the longest length, so you don't need to worry about multiple solutions."

      "content": "If you decide to use a suffix array or a suffix tree, remember that they can help in efficiently finding repeated substrings. However, they can be complex to implement."
