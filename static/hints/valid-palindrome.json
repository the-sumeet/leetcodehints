    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to ignore case differences. This means you should convert all uppercase letters in the string to lowercase. Consider using a method like `.lower()` in Python."
    },
    {
      "content": "You also need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from the string. Alphanumeric characters are letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and numbers. Think about how you can filter out unwanted characters."
    },
    {
      "content": "To filter out non-alphanumeric characters, you can iterate over the string and check if each character is alphanumeric. In Python, you can use the `.isalnum()` method for this purpose."

      "content": "Once you have a cleaned version of the string (lowercase and only alphanumeric characters), you can check if it reads the same forwards and backwards. How would you reverse a string in your chosen programming language?"

      "content": "Think about how you will implement the palindrome check. You could compare the cleaned string with its reverse. In Python, you can reverse a string using slicing: `cleaned_string[::-1]`."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the input constraints properly. The input string can be as long as 200,000 characters. Consider the efficiency of your approach to ensure it runs within time limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a two-pointer technique for an efficient solution. Start one pointer at the beginning of the cleaned string and another at the end, and compare the characters they point to."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, if the characters at both pointers match, move the pointers towards the center. If they don't match at any point, return false. If you successfully compare all characters, return true."
