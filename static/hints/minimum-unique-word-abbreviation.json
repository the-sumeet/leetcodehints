    {
      "content": "Consider how to generate all possible abbreviations for the target word. You can use a binary representation to decide whether to keep a letter or replace it with a count. For example, for 'apple', the binary '010' could mean keep 'a', skip 'p', and keep 'l'."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to check if an abbreviation is unique. An abbreviation is unique if it does not match any abbreviation of the words in the provided dictionary. You will need a way to generate abbreviations for each word in the dictionary as well."

    {
      "content": "When generating abbreviations, consider the length of the abbreviation. If an abbreviation is longer than the original word, it is not valid. For example, 'apple' should not be abbreviated to 'appl3' since it has more characters."
