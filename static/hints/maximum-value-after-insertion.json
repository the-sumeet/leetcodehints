      "content": "Think about the positions where you can insert the digit. For a positive number, you want to insert 'x' before the first digit that is smaller than 'x'. For a negative number, you should insert 'x' before the first digit that is larger than 'x'."

      "content": "When dealing with a negative number, remember that inserting 'x' in front of a larger digit will yield a smaller overall value. Thus, the strategy will differ based on the sign of 'n'."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where 'n' consists of repeated digits or is already at its maximum. For example, if 'n' is '999' and 'x' is '9', inserting 'x' anywhere will yield the same result."

      "content": "Remember to account for the case where 'x' is larger than all digits in 'n'. In this case, you'll want to insert 'x' at the end of the string."
