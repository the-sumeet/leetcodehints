      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the graph. Each edge is represented as a triplet [u, v, dis], indicating a connection between nodes u and v with a distance dis. Make sure you visualize how these edges connect the nodes."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the graph in a way that allows easy traversal. An adjacency list or a union-find structure could be useful for efficiently checking connectivity between nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the 'strictly less than' condition in the queries. This means that any edge on the path must have a distance that is less than the specified limit. Think about how this condition affects path selection."

      "content": "Before diving into the queries, think about preprocessing the edges. Sorting the edges by distance can help you efficiently determine which edges can be used for each query."
    },
    {
      "content": "For each query, you need to find if there exists a path between nodes p and q under the given limit. This suggests a need for a search algorithm that can operate under constraints, like DFS or BFS."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a union-find (disjoint set) data structure. This can help you dynamically connect nodes as you process edges that are below the current query limit."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing the queries, iterate through them in increasing order of their limit. This allows you to build the graph incrementally, adding edges that are valid for the current query."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you process each query, remember to check if nodes p and q are in the same connected component using the union-find structure. If they are, you can return true for that query."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle multiple edges between the same nodes correctly. The algorithm should still work regardless of how many edges exist between any two nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when there are no edges or when all edges exceed the limit specified in a query. How should your algorithm handle these situations?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the constraints allow for up to 100,000 edges and queries. Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of these constraints."
