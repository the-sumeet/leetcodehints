      "content": "Start by understanding the game rules clearly. Alice removes the minimum element from `nums`, followed by Bob. Make sure to keep track of the order in which they remove elements."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can find the minimum element in the list. You might want to use a sorting method or a loop to identify the smallest number efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that `nums` is modified in each round. After Alice and Bob remove their elements, the size of `nums` decreases. Make sure to handle this correctly in your implementation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a loop to repeat the process until `nums` is empty. Each iteration will represent a round of the game. You can use a while loop for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "When appending elements to `arr`, remember the order: Bob appends his removed element first, followed by Alice. This order is crucial for the final output."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since `nums` has an even length, you can guarantee that both Alice and Bob will always have elements to remove. This simplifies your logic since you don't need to handle odd-length cases."

    {
      "content": "You may want to sort `nums` at the beginning to easily access the minimum elements. However, think about the implications of sorting on the performance and whether itâ€™s necessary."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the logic, ensure that after each round, you are correctly removing the elements from `nums`. You can use list methods like `remove()` or slicing."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the minimum elements are the same. How will your logic handle ties? Make sure that the order of removal still respects the game rules."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, after implementing the main logic, make sure to return the `arr` as your result. It should contain the elements in the order they were appended by Bob and Alice."

    "The input array `nums` is guaranteed to have an even length.",
    "Alice and Bob will always have elements to remove since `nums` is even.",
    "The output array `arr` must reflect the order in which Bob and Alice append their removed elements.",
    "Pay attention to the order of operations: Bob appends first, then Alice."
