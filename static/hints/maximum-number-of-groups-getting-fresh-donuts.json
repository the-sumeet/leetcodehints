      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement. You need to serve groups of customers in a way that maximizes the number of happy groups. A group is happy if they receive fresh donuts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the batch size affects the serving of groups. If a groupâ€™s size is larger than the batch size, they will never be happy since they can't be fully served at once."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints provided. The batch size can range from 1 to 9, and the number of groups can be up to 30. This suggests that a brute force solution might be feasible."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can rearrange the groups. This means you should explore different permutations of the groups to find the optimal arrangement that maximizes happy groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the modulo operation with the batch size. Groups that fit perfectly within the batch size (i.e., groups[i] % batchSize == 0) will not contribute to happy groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to keep track of the number of donuts served. You can maintain a running total of served donuts to determine if a new group can be served fresh donuts."

    {
      "content": "You might want to categorize groups based on their sizes. For example, groups that are smaller than the batch size can be potential candidates for being happy."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to find a greedy strategy. For instance, you could prioritize serving smaller groups first to maximize the number of happy groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when all groups are larger than the batch size. How would this impact your solution? Would any groups be happy in this scenario?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about dynamic programming. You could create a DP table where each state represents the maximum number of happy groups that can be achieved with a certain number of served donuts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the order in which you serve groups matters. You could use backtracking to explore all possible arrangements of groups and count the happy ones."

      "content": "Consider using a recursive approach to explore different group arrangements while keeping track of the current number of happy groups."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, make sure to handle the case where a group cannot be served fresh donuts due to leftovers from previous groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a helper function that checks if a group can be happy based on the current state of served donuts."
