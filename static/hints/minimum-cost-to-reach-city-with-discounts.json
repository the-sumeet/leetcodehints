      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement. You need to find the minimum cost to reach a city, given a list of roads with their respective costs. Each road can have a discount applied to it, which can affect the overall cost."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would represent the cities and roads. A common approach is to use a graph where cities are nodes and roads are edges with weights corresponding to the costs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to apply the discounts effectively. You can apply a discount to a road only if you have a certain number of discounts available. This means you need to track how many discounts you have left as you explore different paths."
    },
    {
      "content": "Use a priority queue or a min-heap to explore the cheapest paths first. This is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, where you always expand the least costly node next."
    },
    {
      "content": "When exploring a road, consider two scenarios: one where you use a discount and one where you don't. This will help you keep track of the minimum cost for each city with and without discounts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when there are no roads or when the number of discounts is zero. How would your approach change in these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to keep track of visited states. Since you can have multiple states for each city depending on the number of discounts used, you might need a 2D array to store the minimum costs."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the algorithm, think about the termination condition. When do you stop exploring? Typically, this is when you've reached the target city or when all possible paths have been explored."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the return format. You need to return the minimum cost to reach the target city, so ensure your final computation reflects this correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, try to outline your approach in pseudocode. This can help clarify your thoughts and ensure you have covered all necessary cases before diving into the actual coding."

    "Cities are indexed from 0 to n-1.",
    "The input roads are represented as a list of lists, where each inner list contains [fromCity, toCity, cost].",
    "Discounts can only be applied to one road at a time.",
    "The output should be the minimum cost to reach the target city, or -1 if it is not reachable."
