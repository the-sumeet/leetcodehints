      "content": "When checking pairs, ensure that you are concatenating the strings correctly. For example, if `nums[i]` is '777' and `nums[j]` is '7', you should check if '7777' equals '777' + '7'."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints. The length of `nums` can be up to 100, and each string can be up to 100 characters long. This means your solution should be efficient enough to handle potentially large inputs."

      "content": "As you iterate through each string in `nums`, check if the complement exists in your dictionary. If it does, you can calculate how many valid pairs can be formed with the current string."
