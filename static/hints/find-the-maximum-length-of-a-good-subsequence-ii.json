      "content": "Consider the implications of the value of `k`. If `k` is 0, your subsequence can only consist of repeated elements. What would that mean for the structure of `nums`?"

      "content": "Identify the unique elements in `nums`. You might want to keep track of the frequency of each element, as this will help you determine how many of each you can include in your subsequence."

      "content": "When `k` is greater than 0, you can afford to have some changes in value. Think about how you can maximize the length of the subsequence while respecting the limit on changes."

      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach: Start with the most frequent elements first. This way, you can fill your subsequence with the most common values and then add in the necessary changes."
