      "content": "Consider how you might compare each day's temperature to the temperatures of the following days. A brute-force approach would involve nested loops, which could lead to a time complexity of O(n^2)."

      "content": "Think about using a stack to keep track of the indices of the days. This can help you efficiently find the next warmer day without needing to check every day after the current one repeatedly."

      "content": "When you encounter a temperature that is higher than the temperature at the index stored at the top of the stack, you can calculate the difference in days. This is because the current day is the next warmer day for the day at the index on the stack."

      "content": "As you implement the stack, ensure that you are correctly maintaining the order of indices. The stack should always have the indices of days in a way that allows you to find the next warmer day efficiently."
