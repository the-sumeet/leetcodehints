      "content": "Consider the length of the pattern. If the pattern has a length of n, the resulting number will have a length of n + 1. This is crucial for correctly indexing your result."

      "content": "Think about the range of digits you can use. You can only use the digits from '1' to '9', and each digit can only be used once. This restriction is important when trying to form the smallest possible number."
