    {
      "content": "Consider how you will traverse the grid. A breadth-first search (BFS) might be a good approach to explore the distances from each building to the empty lands. Think about how BFS explores nodes layer by layer."

      "content": "Remember that you need to calculate distances from multiple buildings. You might want to maintain a distance sum for each empty land cell as you perform BFS from each building."

    {
      "content": "As you perform BFS, keep track of the number of buildings that can reach each empty land cell. This will help you determine if a cell is reachable from all buildings."
