      "content": "Remember that the problem requires you to update the node's value to the original value plus the sum of all greater values. So, for each node, you need to add the current running total to its original value."

      "content": "When implementing the traversal, you may want to use recursion or an iterative approach with a stack. Both methods can achieve the same result, but recursion is often simpler to implement for tree traversals."

      "content": "As you implement the solution, ensure that you are modifying the tree in place. This means you should not create new nodes but rather update the existing nodes with their new values."
