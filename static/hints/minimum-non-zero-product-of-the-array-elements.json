      "content": "Consider the operation allowed: swapping bits between any two numbers. This means that the overall structure of the numbers can change, but the individual bits can be rearranged. Think about what this means for the product of the numbers."

      "content": "When calculating the product, remember that the minimum product must be non-zero. This means you cannot have any zeros in your final product calculation. How can you ensure that all numbers remain non-zero after swapping bits?"
