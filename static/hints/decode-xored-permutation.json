      "content": "Remember that XOR has specific properties: `a XOR a = 0` and `a XOR 0 = a`. This means if you know one of the numbers, you can easily find the other using XOR."

    {
      "content": "Since `n` is always odd, the length of `encoded` is even. This is important because it guarantees that the number of elements in `perm` will always be one more than in `encoded`."

      "content": "Once you have the first element of `perm`, you can iteratively compute the rest of the elements. Use the relationship `perm[i + 1] = encoded[i] XOR perm[i]` to build the array."
