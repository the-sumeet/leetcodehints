      "content": "Start by understanding what a 'lucky number' is in this context. Typically, lucky numbers are defined by a specific property or sequence. Make sure you clarify what defines a lucky number in this problem."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you might generate lucky numbers. You may want to begin with a simple approach, such as iterating through numbers and checking if they meet the lucky criteria. Think about a basic loop structure."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your approach. Generating lucky numbers one by one could be slow, especially for larger values of K. Consider whether there is a mathematical way to generate lucky numbers instead of checking each number sequentially."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to think about edge cases. What happens if K is 1 or if K is very large? You should ensure your solution can handle these extremes without failing."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a list or a set to store the lucky numbers you generate. This will allow you to easily access the K-th lucky number once you have generated enough of them."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you're generating lucky numbers in a sequence, think about how you can keep track of the count of lucky numbers found so far. You might want to maintain a counter variable as you generate them."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may also want to think about the possibility of duplicates. If lucky numbers can repeat, how will you ensure that your list only contains unique values? Using a set instead of a list can help with this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have generated enough lucky numbers, accessing the K-th number will depend on how you have stored them. If you're using a list, remember that lists are zero-indexed in most programming languages."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, consider the performance implications of your approach. If you're generating lucky numbers up to a very high K, you might need to optimize your generation method to avoid excessive computation time."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the K-th lucky number. Ensure that your function has the correct return type and format as specified in the problem statement."
