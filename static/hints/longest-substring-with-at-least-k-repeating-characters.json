      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to find the longest substring where each character appears at least 'k' times. Consider how you can track character frequencies as you explore substrings."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the string. A common approach is to use a sliding window technique, which allows you to expand and contract your substring efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate, maintain a count of the characters in the current substring. This can be done using a dictionary or an array. Remember to update this count as you add or remove characters from your substring."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to check if all characters in your current substring meet the frequency requirement. You might want to keep a separate count of how many unique characters meet or exceed 'k' occurrences."
    },
    {
      "content": "What happens if a character in your substring drops below 'k' occurrences? You will need to adjust your substring accordingly. Think about how to shrink the window from the left side."

    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. You are limited to lowercase English letters and the length of the string can be up to 10,000. This suggests that a solution with a time complexity better than O(n^2) would be ideal."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a recursive approach or divide the problem into smaller subproblems. For instance, you could try to break the string into parts based on character frequencies and solve for each part."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can use a helper function to check if a substring meets the condition of having all characters with a frequency of at least 'k'. This could simplify your main logic."

    {
      "content": "Finally, after iterating through the string and checking substrings, remember to keep track of the maximum length found. Ensure your function returns this value at the end."
