      "content": "Think about how you would handle cases where 'x' is less than the smallest element or greater than the largest element in the array. How would that affect your selection of 'k' closest elements?"

      "content": "When determining which elements are closest to 'x', remember to consider both the absolute difference and the order of elements. If two elements have the same distance to 'x', the smaller element should be prioritized."

      "content": "Consider using a min-heap or priority queue if you want to manage the closest elements dynamically while ensuring they are sorted. This could be useful if you're dealing with larger datasets."
