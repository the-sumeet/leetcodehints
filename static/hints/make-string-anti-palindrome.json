      "content": "Consider the properties of palindromes. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. Think about how you can manipulate characters in a string to ensure that this property does not hold for any substring."

      "content": "Look at the frequency of characters in the string. If a character appears too many times, it may lead to palindromic patterns. Counting the occurrences of each character can help you identify potential issues."
