      "content": "Think about the binary representation of the number n. Each bit in the binary representation corresponds to a power of 2. How might this help in determining the minimum operations needed?"

      "content": "Consider the effect of adding and subtracting powers of 2. For example, if you add a power of 2, how does that affect the number of operations needed to reach zero? Is it always beneficial to add a power of 2?"

      "content": "When you subtract a power of 2, it can potentially bring you closer to zero. Think about the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to n. How can you utilize this in your approach?"
