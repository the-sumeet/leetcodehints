      "content": "Start by understanding the definition of a stable subarray. A subarray is stable if the highest common factor (HCF) of all its elements is at least 2. This means that all elements in that subarray share a common divisor greater than 1."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to compute the HCF of a subarray. You can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the HCF of two numbers, and extend this to an array using a loop or recursion."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to identify subarrays in the given array. You can use a nested loop to generate all possible subarrays, but remember that this could be inefficient for larger arrays."

      "content": "Since you can modify at most `maxC` elements, consider how changing elements might affect the HCF of subarrays. What values would you change to maximize the effect on the HCF?"

      "content": "Explore edge cases where `maxC` is 0. In this scenario, you cannot modify any elements. What would be the minimum stability factor in such cases?"

    {
      "content": "To minimize the stability factor, you need to ensure that the largest stable subarray remains as small as possible. Consider how to systematically reduce the HCF of the longest stable subarrays."

      "content": "Think about the implications of the HCF being 2. If you can ensure that no subarray has an HCF of 2 or more, what would be the resulting stability factor?"
