    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the AND and XOR operations. The XOR operation can flip bits, while the AND operation can only keep bits that are set in both operands. This means you can potentially reduce the value of `nums[i]` to control the overall XOR of the array."

      "content": "Examine the bitwise properties of XOR. Remember that the XOR of a number with itself is 0, and the XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself. This can help you think about how to manipulate the numbers to achieve a higher overall XOR."

    {
      "content": "Think about the maximum possible XOR value you can achieve. The maximum XOR for a set of numbers is often related to the highest bits that can be set. For instance, if you can manipulate numbers to have higher bits set, you can increase the overall XOR."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when all elements are the same or when they are all zero. How would the operations affect the XOR in these scenarios? Can you still achieve a higher XOR, or is it already maximized?"

      "content": "Try to derive the maximum possible XOR without performing operations first. Calculate the XOR of the original array and see if it can be improved by applying the operations. This gives you a baseline to work from."

      "content": "Explore how you might choose `x` strategically. For example, if you know the current bit configuration of your numbers, you can choose `x` to target specific bits that are currently not set in the XOR result."
