      "content": "Consider the range of possible values for `x`. Since the elements in the array are non-negative integers, `x` can range from 0 to the length of the array. Why is it important to limit `x` to this range?"

      "content": "After sorting the array, think about how you can determine the count of elements that are greater than or equal to a given `x`. You can iterate through the sorted array and maintain a count of elements that meet the condition."
