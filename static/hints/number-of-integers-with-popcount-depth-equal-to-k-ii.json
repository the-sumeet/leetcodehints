      "content": "Start by understanding the concept of popcount. The popcount of a number is simply the number of 1's in its binary representation. For example, the popcount of 7 (which is '111' in binary) is 3."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, focus on how to compute the popcount-depth of a number. You need to repeatedly apply the popcount function until you reach 1. Keep track of how many times you apply this function."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to implement the popcount function efficiently. You can use Python's built-in function `bin(x).count('1')` to get the popcount of x. Think about how you would apply this in a loop."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the queries can be of two types: one for counting indices with a specific popcount-depth and another for updating an element in the array. Make sure to handle both types appropriately."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing the counting query, you'll need to iterate through a specified range of the nums array. Ensure you correctly implement the bounds given by l and r in the query."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints, especially the size of nums and the values it can hold. With n up to 100,000 and nums[i] up to 10^15, your solution needs to be efficient."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a dictionary or a list to cache the popcount-depth results for numbers that have already been computed. This can save time when the same number is queried multiple times."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the update query, remember to recalculate the popcount-depth for the updated number. This is crucial since the depth may change after the update."

      "content": "Think about how you can structure your solution to handle multiple queries efficiently. You might want to use a loop to process each query and maintain the state of nums."

      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, review the performance of your approach. An O(n) solution for each query could lead to time limits being exceeded, so aim for a more efficient strategy."
