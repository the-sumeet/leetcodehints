      "content": "Consider the properties of sorted arrays. Since each array is sorted in ascending order, the smallest element will always be at index 0 and the largest at the last index. This can help you quickly identify potential candidates for maximum distance."

      "content": "Think about how you can select elements from two different arrays. You need to ensure that the integers you choose come from different arrays. This means you should iterate through pairs of arrays."
