      "content": "Consider the range of numbers you can guess. When you guess a number, you split the range into two parts: those higher than your guess and those lower. This division is key to minimizing your cost."

    {
      "content": "Think about the worst-case scenario for each guess. If you guess a number x and it's incorrect, you will have to pay x dollars. You need to account for the worst-case cost of subsequent guesses."

      "content": "Dynamic programming could be a useful approach here. Define a function `dp(start, end)` that returns the minimum cost to guarantee a win between the numbers `start` and `end`."

      "content": "Think about base cases. For example, if there's only one number (n = 1), the cost is 0 because you can guess it without any loss. Similarly, for two numbers, you can derive a straightforward cost."
