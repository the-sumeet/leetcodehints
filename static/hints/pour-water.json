    {
      "content": "Think about how you would represent the pouring of water. When you pour water at a specific index, it should first check the left and right sides to determine where the water can flow. This involves comparing the heights of the columns."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the water might not flow at all. For instance, if the column at the pour index is already the tallest or if all adjacent columns are of equal height, the water will simply stay at the pour index."

    {
      "content": "When pouring water, you need to find the lowest adjacent column. If there are multiple columns of the same height, you should pour the water into the leftmost one first. This requires careful handling of indices."

      "content": "You might want to create a helper function that determines the position where the water will flow. This function can take the current index and the heights array as inputs and return the new index where the water will settle."

      "content": "After pouring water, you need to update the heights array. Make sure you increment the height at the index where the water settles. This means you will need to keep track of how many times you pour water into each index."
