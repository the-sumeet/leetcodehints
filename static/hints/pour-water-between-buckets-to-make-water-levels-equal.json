    {
      "content": "Think about the total amount of water available across all buckets. The average water level could help you figure out what the target level should be. Remember, the target level must be achievable based on the current levels."

      "content": "When calculating the target water level, ensure you handle cases where the total water isn't evenly divisible by the number of buckets. This might lead to some buckets having slightly different levels."

      "content": "Consider how you can pour water from one bucket to another. You might want to keep track of which buckets are currently above or below the target level."

    {
      "content": "As you think about pouring water, remember that you can only pour from a bucket that has more water than the target level to one that has less. This will help you narrow down your operations."

      "content": "Think about how you can implement a loop to repeatedly pour water between buckets until all levels are equal. You might want to use a while loop that continues until no buckets need adjustment."

      "content": "When implementing the logic, ensure you check each bucket's level against the target level in each iteration. You may want to use a helper function to determine if any adjustments are still needed."

      "content": "Finally, consider how you will return the result. You might want to return the number of pours made or the final state of the buckets. Make sure your return format matches the requirements."
