      "content": "To identify an alternating pattern, consider how you can check pairs of adjacent elements. For two elements nums[i] and nums[i+1], check if nums[i+1] - nums[i] equals 1. This is the starting condition for an alternating subarray."

    {
      "content": "Once you find a valid starting pair, keep extending the subarray by checking the next element. For each new element nums[i+2], ensure it alternates correctly by checking if nums[i+2] equals nums[i+1] - 1."
