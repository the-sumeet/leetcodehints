      "content": "Think about the total number of ways to choose n balls from the 2n balls. This is a combinatorial problem. You can use the binomial coefficient to calculate the total distributions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the order of balls in the boxes matters. For example, having ball A in box 1 and ball B in box 2 is different from having ball B in box 1 and ball A in box 2."

      "content": "Think about how you can generate all possible distributions of the balls. You might want to use recursion or backtracking to explore all combinations of distributing the balls."

      "content": "As you generate distributions, keep track of how many distinct colors are in each box. You can increment counters for distinct colors as you assign balls to boxes."
