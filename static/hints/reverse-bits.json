      "content": "Start by understanding how to represent the integer in binary. A 32-bit signed integer can be represented using 32 bits, where the leftmost bit is the sign bit. For example, the number 43261596 in binary is '00000010100101000001111010011100'."
    },
    {
      "content": "To reverse the bits, think about how you would swap the bits from the left side with those on the right side. This means the first bit becomes the last, the second bit becomes the second last, and so on."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use bit manipulation to achieve this. A common approach is to use bitwise operations like AND, OR, and shifts. For instance, you can isolate the least significant bit using `n & 1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a loop that runs for 32 iterations (since you are dealing with a 32-bit integer). In each iteration, you can shift the bits of the original number and build the reversed number bit by bit."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to keep track of the reversed number as you build it. You can initialize the reversed number to 0 and update it in each iteration. For example, if `reversed` is your result, you can do: `reversed = (reversed << 1) | (n & 1)`."
    },
    {
      "content": "After each operation, make sure to shift the original number to the right to process the next bit. You can do this by using `n >>= 1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the edge cases. For example, if `n` is 0, the reversed bits should also be 0. What happens if `n` is the maximum value of a 32-bit signed integer?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints provided. The problem states that `n` is even. This means the least significant bit will always be 0, which could simplify your logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you need to optimize for multiple calls, consider caching results. You could store previously computed reversed values in a dictionary to avoid recalculating them."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the loop and bit manipulation logic you have devised. Make sure to return the final reversed number after the loop completes. Remember to handle the output format correctly, which should be an integer."
