      "content": "Notice that if a dish has a negative satisfaction level, it may reduce the overall like-time coefficient. Think about whether you should include such dishes."

      "content": "Sorting the satisfaction levels can help. If you sort the array in ascending order, you can evaluate the impact of including or excluding dishes more easily."

      "content": "After sorting, consider starting from the highest satisfaction dish and working backwards to see if including lower satisfaction dishes increases the total."

    {
      "content": "Think about the cumulative nature of the time variable. Each dish contributes to the total time, so the position of each dish in the cooking order matters significantly."

      "content": "Create a function that calculates the total like-time coefficient for a given set of dishes. This will help you test different combinations of included dishes."

      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach. Start with the highest satisfaction dish and keep adding dishes as long as they increase the total like-time coefficient."

    {
      "content": "What if you reached a point where adding a dish decreases the total? You should stop adding dishes at that point."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you can discard dishes. If the satisfaction level of a dish is low enough, it may be beneficial to skip it entirely."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when all satisfaction levels are negative. In such cases, the maximum like-time coefficient would be zero since no dishes should be cooked."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, be mindful of the constraints. The maximum length of the satisfaction array is 500, so ensure your approach is efficient."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the impact of the order of dishes after sorting. If you start from the least satisfying dish and move to the most, you may find a point where the total starts to decrease."

    {
      "content": "To summarize, you want to maximize the sum of the like-time coefficients by carefully selecting which dishes to cook based on their satisfaction levels and the order of cooking."
