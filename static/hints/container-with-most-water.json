      "content": "To solve this problem, start by understanding how the area of water is calculated between two lines. The area is determined by the formula: `Area = min(height[i], height[j]) * (j - i)`, where `i` and `j` are the indices of the two lines."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the height of the lines. The amount of water that can be contained is limited by the shorter line, so you should always consider the minimum height when calculating the area."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to find pairs of lines. A brute-force approach would involve checking every pair of lines, but this could be inefficient for large inputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Instead of checking every combination, consider using two pointers. Start with one pointer at the beginning of the array and another at the end. This will help you efficiently narrow down the potential maximum area."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using two pointers, after calculating the area, decide which pointer to move. You should move the pointer that points to the shorter line, as this could potentially lead to a taller line and a larger area."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep track of the maximum area found during your iterations. You can initialize a variable `maxArea` to store this value and update it whenever you find a larger area."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when the height array has only two elements. The area in this case will simply be the height of the shorter line multiplied by the distance between the two lines."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. The height values can be as large as 10^4 and the number of lines can go up to 10^5. Make sure your solution is efficient enough to handle these limits."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure that you are correctly updating the pointers and calculating the area at each step. Debugging with small input cases can help verify that your logic is sound."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, after iterating through the array with your two-pointer approach, return the value stored in `maxArea`. This will be the maximum amount of water that can be contained."
