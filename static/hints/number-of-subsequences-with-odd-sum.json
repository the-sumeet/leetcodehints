      "content": "Consider the properties of odd and even numbers. A sum is odd if it contains an odd number of odd integers. This means you need to focus on how many odd and even numbers are present in the array."

      "content": "Count the number of odd and even numbers in the input array. You can use a simple loop to iterate through the array and maintain two counters: one for odds and one for evens."

      "content": "Think about how to form subsequences with odd sums. You can form subsequences by choosing any combination of the even numbers (including choosing none) and an odd number of odd numbers."

    {
      "content": "If you have `oddCount` odd numbers, the number of ways to choose an odd number of them can be calculated using combinatorial logic. Remember that the total number of subsets of `n` items is `2^n`, but you need to consider only the odd-sized subsets."

      "content": "Now, consider how the even numbers contribute. Since any combination of even numbers can be included (including none), for `evenCount` even numbers, there are `2^evenCount` possible combinations."

    {
      "content": "Combine your findings: for each valid selection of odd numbers that results in an odd sum, multiply it by the number of combinations of even numbers. This will give you the total number of valid subsequences."

    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when the input array is empty or contains only even numbers. In such cases, the number of valid subsequences with an odd sum should be zero."
