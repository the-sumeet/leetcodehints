    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that for a set of requests to be achievable, the net change in employees for each building must be zero. This means that the number of employees leaving a building must equal the number of employees entering it."

      "content": "Consider how you can represent the net change for each building. You might want to use an array of size 'n' initialized to zero, where each index represents a building."

      "content": "When processing each request, you can increment the count for the 'to' building and decrement for the 'from' building. This will help you track the net changes."

      "content": "Think about how you can use backtracking to explore different combinations of requests. You can either include a request or exclude it, which will help you find the maximum number of achievable requests."

      "content": "As you explore combinations, keep track of the count of requests you've included. Use a variable to store the maximum count found so far."

      "content": "While iterating through the requests, if you reach the end of the list, check if the net change for all buildings is zero. If it is, update your maximum count."

      "content": "As you build your solution, consider the time complexity. Since 'n' can be up to 20 and requests can be up to 16, ensure your approach can handle the maximum input sizes efficiently."
