      "content": "Familiarize yourself with how to calculate the GCD of two numbers. You can use the Euclidean algorithm, which is efficient and works well for this problem."

      "content": "Remember that the LCM (Least Common Multiple) of two numbers can be computed using the formula: LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y). This will be essential when you find non-coprime pairs."

      "content": "Think about how you will modify the array when you find a non-coprime pair. You will need to remove the two numbers and insert their LCM in their place."

      "content": "After replacing a pair, you may need to check the new adjacent pairs again. Make sure your loop accounts for this to avoid missing any potential replacements."
