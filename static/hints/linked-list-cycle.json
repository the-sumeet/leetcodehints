      "content": "Consider the simplest cases first. If the linked list is empty (head is null), can it have a cycle? Think about the implications of having no nodes."

    {
      "content": "Next, think about the case where the list has only one node. If that node points to itself, there is a cycle; if it points to null, there isn't. What conditions determine a cycle in this scenario?"

    {
      "content": "To detect a cycle, you might want to use two pointers. One pointer moves one step at a time (slow), and the other moves two steps at a time (fast). What do you think will happen if there is a cycle?"

      "content": "If the fast pointer catches up to the slow pointer, it indicates a cycle. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list (null), then there is no cycle. Can you outline how you would implement this logic?"
