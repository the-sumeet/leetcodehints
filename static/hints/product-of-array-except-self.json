      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to calculate the product of all elements in the array except for the current element. Think about how you might approach this without using division."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the product of all elements to the left of each index. You might want to create a separate array to store these products temporarily."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, think about how you can calculate the product of all elements to the right of each index. This could also be stored in a separate array, but remember, you want to optimize for space."
    },
    {
      "content": "Instead of using two separate arrays, think about how you could use the output array itself to store the left products first. This way, you can save space."
    },
    {
      "content": "After populating the output array with left products, you can iterate through the array again to calculate the right products. Use a variable to keep track of the running product from the right side."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be cautious of edge cases, such as when the input array contains zeros. How does the presence of zeros affect the product calculations?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the output array should be filled with the final products. After your second pass, ensure that each index has the correct product of all other elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity. You need to ensure that your solution runs in O(n) time. Each element should only be processed a constant number of times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Also, consider the space complexity. The problem asks for O(1) extra space, which means you cannot use additional arrays for storing products. You can only use a few variables."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, try to outline your approach in pseudocode. For example: Initialize the output array, compute left products, then compute right products while updating the output array."
