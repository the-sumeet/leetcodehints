      "content": "Think about the possible sums you can achieve with different combinations of elements. You might want to explore the concept of subsets and how to generate them from the original array."

      "content": "Since the array can have up to 40 elements, generating all possible subsequences directly may lead to a combinatorial explosion. Consider using techniques that can help reduce the number of combinations you need to check."

      "content": "A common approach for problems involving subsets is to use a method called 'meet in the middle'. This involves splitting the array into two halves, calculating possible sums for each half, and then combining results."

      "content": "When generating sums from subsequences, keep track of their absolute differences from the goal. You will need to minimize this difference, so consider how to efficiently store and compare these differences."

      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, such as when the array contains all negative numbers or when the goal is also negative. How might this affect the sums you can achieve?"

      "content": "Consider using a set or a list to store the sums you calculate from the subsequences. This will allow you to easily check how close each sum is to the goal."

      "content": "Remember that the absolute difference is calculated as abs(sum - goal). This means that both overshooting and undershooting the goal are equally important to consider."

      "content": "Once you have a list of possible sums, you can iterate through them to find the one that minimizes the absolute difference. Make sure to handle the case where no elements are chosen, which results in a sum of 0."
