      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to append `k` unique positive integers to the given array `nums` such that these integers are not already present in `nums`."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently determine which integers are already in `nums`. A good approach is to use a set to store the elements of `nums` for O(1) average time complexity lookups."

    {
      "content": "Consider the smallest positive integers first, as you want to minimize the sum of the appended integers. Start checking from 1 upwards to find integers not in `nums`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you check for integers to append, keep a count of how many unique integers you have found that are not in `nums`. You need to stop once you have found `k` such integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where `nums` contains large integers. The range of integers you check should start from 1 and go upwards, but you only need to check until you have found `k` unique integers."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. For example, if `nums` contains all integers from 1 to `n`, you will need to start checking from `n + 1`."

      "content": "Once you have found the `k` unique integers, calculate their sum. This is the value you will return as your result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^8`. This means your solution needs to be efficient, ideally O(n) or O(k) in terms of time complexity."

      "content": "Make sure to account for the uniqueness of the integers you are appending. If you encounter an integer that is already in `nums`, skip it and continue searching."

      "content": "To summarize, your approach will involve creating a set from `nums`, iterating through integers starting from 1, checking for uniqueness, and summing up the first `k` unique integers you find."
