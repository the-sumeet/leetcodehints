Remember that in a BST, for any given node, the left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the node's value, and the right subtree contains only nodes with values greater."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can traverse both trees. You might want to consider using in-order traversal to get a sorted list of values from each BST. This could help you in finding pairs that sum up to the target value."

      "content": "Consider using a set or a hash table to store the values from one of the trees. This will allow you to quickly check if the complement of a value (i.e., target - current value) exists in the other tree."
