      "content": "Consider the edge cases where the balloon you are bursting is at the beginning or the end of the array. Remember that if you burst the first or last balloon, you should treat the out-of-bounds index as 1."

      "content": "Think about the order in which you burst the balloons. The maximum coins you can collect may depend heavily on the sequence of bursts."

      "content": "When filling the DP table, consider the last balloon to burst in the range [i, j]. This choice will affect the coins collected from the balloons adjacent to it."
