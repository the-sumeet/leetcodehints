      "content": "Since the result might exceed 24, think about how to handle this. You can use the modulo operator `%` to find the equivalent hour in a 24-hour format. For example: `newTime % 24`."

      "content": "Finally, put everything together: calculate the new time using the formula `newTime = (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24`. This should give you the correct arrival hour."
