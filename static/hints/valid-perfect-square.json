    {
      "content": "Consider how you might check if a number is a perfect square without using built-in functions. You could think about iterating through possible integers and checking their squares."

    {
      "content": "Think about the range of integers you need to check. Since you're given that 1 <= num <= 2^31 - 1, what is the maximum integer you would need to check? Remember, you only need to check integers up to the square root of num."

      "content": "You could use a loop to iterate through integers starting from 1. For each integer, calculate its square and compare it with num. Consider how you would stop the loop when the square exceeds num."

      "content": "When iterating, you might want to use a variable to keep track of the current integer. If you find that the square of this integer equals num, you can return true."

      "content": "What happens if you reach a point where the square of your current integer exceeds num? This means num cannot be a perfect square, and you should return false at that point."

      "content": "You might want to optimize your approach. Instead of checking every integer up to num, consider using a binary search method to find the integer whose square is closest to num."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you choose binary search, set your left pointer to 1 and your right pointer to num. Calculate the midpoint and check if its square is equal to num, less than, or greater than num."

      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your function handles all edge cases and returns the correct boolean value. Remember to test your function with various inputs, including both perfect squares and non-perfect squares."
