      "content": "Start by understanding the transformation process. Each element in the array is transformed based on its neighbors. Specifically, for each element, you will need to consider the elements directly before and after it."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array. You might want to use a loop to access each element and its neighbors. Remember, the first and last elements have only one neighbor, so handle these cases separately."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the transformation affects the array. For each element, you'll need to compute a new value based on the sum of its neighbors. This will require you to keep track of the original array while you compute the new values."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you compute the new values, think about how to store them. You can create a new array to hold these transformed values, or you could modify the original array in place. Which approach do you think is more efficient?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, especially with small arrays. For example, what happens if the array has only one element? How should you handle that in your transformation logic?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the return format of your result. Are you expected to return the transformed array as a new array, or can you return the original array after modifying it? Clarifying this will help you structure your solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the possibility of multiple transformations. If the problem allows for repeated transformations, you will need to implement a way to continue transforming the array until a stopping condition is met."
    },
    {
      "content": "In cases where the transformation leads to no change, how will you determine that? You might need to compare the original array with the transformed array to check for equality."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases like empty arrays, arrays with identical elements, and arrays with negative numbers. This will help ensure your solution is robust."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, consider how to implement the transformation efficiently. You might want to think about the time complexity of your approach. Can you achieve this in linear time, or will it require nested loops?"
