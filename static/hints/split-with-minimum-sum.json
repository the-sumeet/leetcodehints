      "content": "Start by understanding the problem's requirements. You need to split the integer `num` into two parts, `num1` and `num2`, such that their concatenation is a permutation of the digits in `num`. Think about how the digits can be rearranged."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the digits of `num`. You might find it helpful to convert `num` into a string or an array of its digits. This way, you can easily manipulate and sort them."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the digits, think about how to minimize the sum of `num1` and `num2`. A good strategy might be to distribute the digits evenly between the two numbers. What would happen if you sorted the digits first?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Sorting the digits is a key step. After sorting, you can alternate placing digits into `num1` and `num2`. This ensures that both numbers are as small as possible. For example, if you have sorted digits [2, 3, 4, 5], you could form `num1` as 24 and `num2` as 35."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `num` has repeated digits. How would this affect your approach? Ensure that your method still produces the minimum sum in such scenarios."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle leading zeros. Since `num1` and `num2` can contain leading zeros, you should not worry about the order of digits in the final numbers. Just focus on the sum."
    },
    {
      "content": "After forming `num1` and `num2`, remember to convert them back from strings (or arrays) to integers before calculating their sum. This is crucial for getting the correct result."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider using a loop or a simple conditional structure to alternate adding digits to `num1` and `num2`. This can be done using an index to track which number to add the next digit to."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, after calculating the sum of `num1` and `num2`, make sure to return this value as the output of your function. Check if your implementation handles all test cases correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "To summarize your approach: Sort the digits of `num`, alternate placing them into `num1` and `num2`, convert to integers, and return their sum. This method should yield the minimum possible sum."
