      "content": "Remember that when they swap one box of candy, the change in their totals will depend on the values of the boxes they exchange. If Alice gives away box `a` and receives box `b`, the new totals can be expressed as: `Alice's new total = Alice's total - a + b`."

    {
      "content": "To achieve equal totals after the swap, you can derive an equation from the difference you calculated earlier. Specifically, you want to find `a` from Alice's boxes and `b` from Bob's boxes such that: `b - a = (totalAlice - totalBob) / 2`."

      "content": "Since the equation involves finding two specific values from two different arrays, consider using a hash set for one of the arrays. This will allow you to quickly check if a required value exists in the other array."
