      "content": "Consider how the number of allowed deletions (k) affects the string. You can remove up to k characters to make the string a palindrome. Think about how this flexibility changes your approach."

      "content": "You might want to use a two-pointer technique to check if a string is a palindrome. This involves comparing characters from the start and end of the string and moving towards the center."
    },
    {
      "content": "When the characters at the two pointers do not match, you have a decision to make: either delete the character at the left pointer or the right pointer. This is where the allowed deletions come into play."
