      "content": "If any index in `nums` has a value greater than `m`, it is impossible to mark that index because you won't have enough seconds to decrement it to zero."

      "content": "As you iterate through the seconds, maintain a count of how many indices have been marked. This will help you determine when all indices are marked."

      "content": "Remember that you can do nothing in a second if there are no available operations that can help you mark an index. This could affect your strategy."
