      "content": "Start by understanding what 'almost-equal' means. Two characters are almost-equal if they are the same or if they are adjacent in the alphabet. For example, 'a' and 'b' are almost-equal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can identify adjacent almost-equal characters in the string. You can iterate through the string and compare each character with the next one to check if they are almost-equal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to modify characters to eliminate adjacent almost-equal pairs. You can change a character to any other lowercase letter that is not almost-equal to its neighbors."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you encounter a pair of almost-equal characters, consider how changing one of them can help. For instance, if you have 'aa', changing one 'a' to 'c' would break the adjacency."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep track of the number of operations you perform. Each time you change a character, increment an operations counter. This will help you determine the minimum number of changes needed."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when the string is very short (e.g., 'a' or 'ab'). How would your approach handle these cases? Make sure your solution works for all lengths."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach where you always change the character that causes the most adjacent almost-equal pairs. This can minimize the number of changes needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to keep a set of characters that are currently in use near the character you are changing. This way, you can quickly find a valid character to change to that won't create new almost-equal pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the string, remember that changing a character may affect future comparisons. Make sure to adjust your logic to account for this when you make a change."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to implement the logic efficiently. You may need to loop through the string multiple times, but aim to do it in a way that minimizes performance issues, especially for the upper limit of the string length."
