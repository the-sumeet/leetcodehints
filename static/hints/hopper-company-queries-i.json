      "content": "When filtering, think about how you can use the 'requested_at' date to determine which rides were accepted after a driver joined. This will be essential for your query logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a LEFT JOIN to ensure you include all drivers, even those who may not have accepted rides. This will help you identify drivers who have not accepted any rides since joining."
