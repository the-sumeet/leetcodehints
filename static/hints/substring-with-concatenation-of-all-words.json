    {
      "content": "As you slide the window across `s`, maintain a count of the words found in the current window. Compare this count to the original word count to determine if the current window is valid."

      "content": "When checking the counts, ensure that the counts of the words in the current window match exactly with the counts from the `words` array. This means both the frequency and the words themselves must match."
