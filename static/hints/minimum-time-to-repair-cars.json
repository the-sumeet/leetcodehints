      "content": "Start by understanding how the time taken by a mechanic to repair cars is calculated. For a mechanic with rank `r` repairing `n` cars, the time taken is `r * n^2`. This means the time grows quadratically with the number of cars repaired by that mechanic."

      "content": "Consider how you can distribute the cars among the mechanics. Since they can work simultaneously, think about how to balance the workload so that the total time is minimized."

      "content": "To find the minimum time, you might want to use a binary search approach. Consider what the range of possible times could be. The minimum time could start from 1 minute, and the maximum time could be calculated based on the worst-case scenario."

      "content": "When checking if a time `t` is feasible, remember that for a mechanic with rank `r`, the number of cars they can repair is limited by the equation `n <= sqrt(t/r)`. This will help you determine how many cars can be repaired by each mechanic."

    {
      "content": "As you implement the feasibility check, sum up the total cars repaired by all mechanics. If this sum is greater than or equal to the total number of cars, then `t` is a feasible time."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the binary search to find the minimum time. Start with the low bound at 1 and the high bound calculated from the maximum rank and number of cars. Adjust your bounds based on the feasibility check."
