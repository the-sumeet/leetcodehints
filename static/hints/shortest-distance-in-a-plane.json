      "content": "Consider how you will store the points. You can use a list of tuples or a list of lists to represent the coordinates of the points in the plane."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the points. You will need to compare each point with every other point to find the shortest distance. This suggests a nested loop structure."

    {
      "content": "When calculating distances, remember to keep track of the minimum distance found so far. You can initialize a variable to a very large number (like infinity) to ensure any calculated distance will be smaller."

      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases. For example, what if there are fewer than two points? You should handle this scenario gracefully, possibly by returning a specific value or message."

      "content": "Consider how to handle points that are the same. If two points have the same coordinates, the distance between them is zero. You might want to check for this condition."

    {
      "content": "Think about the return format. Should you return just the distance, or do you also need to return the points that yield this distance? Clarifying this will help you structure your output."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the nested loop, remember to avoid calculating the distance from a point to itself. You can do this by ensuring that the indices of the two points being compared are not the same."

      "content": "After calculating distances, ensure you are correctly updating your minimum distance variable. If you find a new minimum distance, update both the distance and potentially the points involved."

      "content": "Finally, once you have the shortest distance, make sure to return it in the required format. If the problem specifies a particular return type (like a float or integer), adhere to that."
