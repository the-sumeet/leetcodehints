      "content": "Start by understanding what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous section of the array, meaning you can pick any starting index and any ending index, provided the ending index is greater than or equal to the starting index."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can generate all possible subarrays from the given array. You can use two nested loops: the outer loop to fix the starting index and the inner loop to fix the ending index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you generate each subarray, think about how to count the distinct elements within that subarray. You might want to utilize a data structure that helps you track unique elements, such as a set."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem asks for the sum of the squares of the distinct counts. So, for each subarray, after calculating the distinct count, you will need to square that count before adding it to your total sum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the array contains only one element. In this case, there is only one subarray, and its distinct count will be 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given: the maximum length of the array is 100 and the values range from 1 to 100. This means you can afford to use approaches that are O(n^2) or even O(n^3) in complexity, as the input size is manageable."
    },
    {
      "content": "When counting distinct elements, make sure to reset your counting mechanism for each new subarray you start. If you are using a set, you will need to clear it at the beginning of each inner loop iteration."
    },
    {
      "content": "After calculating the distinct counts for all subarrays, ensure you handle the summing of squares correctly. You might want to initialize a variable to keep track of the total sum outside your loops."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider printing intermediate results to verify that you are correctly counting distinct elements and summing their squares."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the total sum of squares after processing all subarrays. Double-check that your return statement is correctly positioned after all calculations are complete."
