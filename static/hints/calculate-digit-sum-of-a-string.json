      "content": "To process the string, you'll need to divide it into groups of size `k`. Think about how you can use a loop to create these groups. For example, you can use slicing in Python to get each group: `s[i:i+k]`."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the groups, you need to calculate the sum of the digits in each group. Consider how you can convert each character in the group to an integer and then sum them up. A simple way to do this is using a list comprehension: `sum(int(digit) for digit in group)`."

    {
      "content": "After calculating the sums for each group, you will replace the original groups with their respective sums. Think about how you can concatenate these sums to form a new string. You might use `''.join()` to combine the results."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `s` has a length equal to `k`. In this case, you won't perform any grouping, and you should return `s` directly. Also, think about what happens if all digits are the same, like in the example '00000000'."
