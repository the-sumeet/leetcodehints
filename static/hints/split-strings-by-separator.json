      "content": "Start by understanding how to split a string in Python. You can use the `split()` method on a string, which allows you to specify a separator. For example, 'a.b.c'.split('.') will give you ['a', 'b', 'c']."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the split method will return a list that may contain empty strings if there are consecutive separators. For instance, 'a..b'.split('.') results in ['a', '', 'b']. You'll need to filter these out later."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will iterate through the array of strings. You can use a loop to go through each string in the `words` array and apply the split method to each one."
    },
    {
      "content": "While processing each string, think about how to collect all the resulting strings into a single list. You can initialize an empty list before the loop and extend it with the results of each split."
    },
    {
      "content": "To exclude empty strings from your final result, you can use a list comprehension or a filter. For example, you can use `filter(lambda x: x != '', split_result)` to keep only non-empty strings."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep in mind the order of the strings. The final output should maintain the order of the strings as they were in the input array. Make sure your approach preserves this order when combining the results."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when a string contains only the separator (like '|||'). In such cases, the split will yield only empty strings, and you should return an empty array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. You have a maximum of 100 strings, each up to 20 characters long. This means your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits comfortably."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to test your function with various separators and strings, including those with leading or trailing separators, to ensure it behaves as expected across different scenarios."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, combine all your parts together. After splitting each string and filtering out empty strings, return the final list. It should look something like this: `return final_list` where `final_list` contains all the valid strings."
