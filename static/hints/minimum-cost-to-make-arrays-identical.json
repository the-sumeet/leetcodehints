      "content": "Focus on the differences between the elements of `arr` and `brr`. For each index `i`, calculate the absolute difference: `diff[i] = |arr[i] - brr[i]|`. This will help you understand how much adjustment is needed."

      "content": "Once you have the differences, consider how you can minimize the cost of adjusting `arr` to match `brr`. You can either adjust elements directly or use the rearrangement operation. Which option is cheaper in various scenarios?"
