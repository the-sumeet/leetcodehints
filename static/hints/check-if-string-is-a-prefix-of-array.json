      "content": "Consider how you can concatenate elements from the `words` array. You can use a loop to iterate through the `words` array and build a new string by appending each word until you either match `s` or exceed its length."

      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. You know that `s` can be at most 1000 characters long, and each word in `words` can be up to 20 characters. This should help you manage your loop effectively."

      "content": "As you concatenate words, keep track of the length of the string you are building. If at any point the length of your concatenated string matches the length of `s`, you should check if they are equal."
