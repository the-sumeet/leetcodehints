      "content": "Consider how you could iterate through both strings. You might want to use two pointers: one for string `s` and another for string `t`. This will help you track your position in both strings as you check for matches."

      "content": "Think about the base cases. What should your function return if `s` is an empty string? Remember that an empty string is a subsequence of any string, including another empty string."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through `t`, if you find a character that matches the current character in `s`, move the pointer for `s` to the next character. This way, you are checking for the next character in `s` sequentially."

      "content": "Consider what happens when you reach the end of string `s`. If you have matched all characters of `s` before exhausting `t`, then `s` is a subsequence of `t`."

      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. A simple two-pointer technique will generally run in O(n + m) time, where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `t`. This is efficient given the constraints."

    {
      "content": "If you are considering multiple strings `s1, s2, ..., sk` to check against the same `t`, think about preprocessing `t`. You could create a mapping of character positions in `t` to quickly check for subsequences."

    {
      "content": "For the follow-up scenario with many incoming `s`, consider using a binary search approach on the preprocessed character positions in `t`. This way, you can quickly determine if the next character in `s` exists in `t`."
