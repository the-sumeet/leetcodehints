      "content": "Consider the concept of connectivity in a graph. A graph is fully traversable by both Alice and Bob if there is a path between every pair of nodes for both of them. Think about how you can check this connectivity for each type of edge."

    {
      "content": "You may want to use a graph traversal algorithm like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine if Alice and Bob can reach all nodes from any starting node. This will help you identify if the graph is initially fully traversable."

      "content": "When checking connectivity, remember to handle the edges based on their types. You might want to build separate graphs for Alice and Bob, one using only their respective edges and another using edges of type 3."

      "content": "After establishing the initial connectivity, think about how you can identify redundant edges. An edge is redundant if removing it does not affect the connectivity of the graph for either Alice or Bob."

      "content": "Consider the edges of type 3 as the most valuable since they can be traversed by both Alice and Bob. Removing these edges should be your last resort since they maintain connectivity for both."

      "content": "Think about the minimum spanning tree (MST) concept. You need to ensure that both Alice and Bob can reach all nodes, which might lead you to consider how many edges are necessary to maintain this connectivity."
