      "content": "Remember that the indices p and q must satisfy the condition 0 < p < q < n - 1. This means that p cannot be the first or last index, and q cannot be the first or last index either."

      "content": "To check if a segment is strictly increasing, you can iterate through the array and compare each element with the next one. For example, for a segment nums[0...p], ensure that nums[i] < nums[i+1] for all i in that range."
