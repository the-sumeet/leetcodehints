      "content": "Consider how you can generate these numbers. You can think of them as a sequence where each number is formed by appending another '1' to the previous number. How would you represent this in code?"

      "content": "Remember that the problem asks for the length of the smallest such number. So, instead of storing the actual number, you might want to keep track of the count of '1's you have appended."

      "content": "Think about how you can check for divisibility by k. Instead of constructing large numbers, you can use the property of modular arithmetic to keep your calculations manageable."

      "content": "You can maintain a variable to keep track of the current number's value modulo k. This way, you can avoid dealing with large integers directly. For example: `current_mod = (current_mod * 10 + 1) % k`."

      "content": "If you exhaust all possible remainders without finding a solution, you should return -1. Make sure your logic accounts for this edge case."

      "content": "As a final touch, ensure your implementation handles the constraints efficiently. You need to be careful with the maximum value of k (up to 100,000) and ensure your algorithm runs in a reasonable time."
