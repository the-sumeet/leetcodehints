      "content": "Think about how you will extract the content from each file. You will need to loop through the list of files and access the 'content' field for each file. Consider how to store the counts for each term."

      "content": "Consider the term you need to count. Is it case-sensitive? If not, you may want to convert both the content and the term to the same case (e.g., lower case) before counting occurrences."

      "content": "To count occurrences, you can use string methods available in your programming language. For example, in Python, you could use the `str.count()` method to count non-overlapping occurrences of the term in each file's content."
