      "content": "Consider how many nodes you have (n) and how they can be arranged in a grid. The grid should have dimensions that can accommodate all nodes, such as a square or rectangular shape."

      "content": "You might want to start by placing one of the nodes in the grid and then explore how to place its adjacent nodes. Consider using a queue or stack to facilitate this process."
