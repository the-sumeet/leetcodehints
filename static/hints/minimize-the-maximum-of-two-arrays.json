      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. You need to ensure that the integers in arr1 are unique and not divisible by divisor1, while those in arr2 are unique and not divisible by divisor2. This means you will have to filter out certain numbers from your selections."

      "content": "When using binary search, define your search space. The minimum possible value is 1 (the smallest positive integer), and the maximum can initially be set to a reasonable upper bound based on the counts of unique integers you need to fill."
