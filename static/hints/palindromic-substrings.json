      "content": "Start by understanding what a palindromic substring is. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters, and a palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, 'aba' is a palindrome, while 'abc' is not."

      "content": "Consider the simplest case where the string has only one character. How many palindromic substrings can you find? Remember, each individual character is a palindrome."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can identify palindromic substrings in a given string. One approach is to expand around potential centers of palindromes. Each character can be a center, and pairs of characters can also be centers for even-length palindromes."
    },
    {
      "content": "When expanding around a center, you can use two pointers. One pointer starts at the center and the other at the edges of the substring. Ensure to check for both odd-length and even-length palindromes."

      "content": "Remember to keep track of the total count of palindromic substrings. You can initialize a counter before starting the expansion process and increment it each time you find a palindrome."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. Expanding around each character can lead to a time complexity of O(n^2). Is this acceptable given the constraints?"

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to handle both odd-length and even-length palindromes efficiently. You might want to create a helper function that takes the string and the center indices as parameters to handle the expansion."
