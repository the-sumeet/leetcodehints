      "content": "To extract the elements of a diagonal, iterate through the matrix. For each starting point in the first row and the first column, gather all the elements that belong to that diagonal into a list."

      "content": "Remember that diagonals can start from both the first row and the first column. Make sure to handle both cases while collecting diagonal elements. Use two loops: one for the first row and another for the first column."
