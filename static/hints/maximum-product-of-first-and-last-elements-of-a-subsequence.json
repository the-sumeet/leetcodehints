      "content": "Consider the size of the subsequence, m. Since you need to find the maximum product of the first and last elements of a subsequence of size m, think about how the choice of these two elements affects the product."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the first and last elements of the subsequence can be any elements from the array, as long as they maintain their order. This means you need to explore combinations of elements that are m positions apart in the original array."

    {
      "content": "To maximize the product of the first and last elements, consider both the largest positive numbers and the smallest (most negative) numbers. Multiplying two negatives can yield a positive product, which might be larger than the product of two positives."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. What happens if m = 1? In this case, the maximum product is simply the square of the maximum element in the array, since the first and last elements are the same."
