      "content": "Think about how many children a node can have in a binary tree. Each non-null node contributes two potential child nodes, which means you'll need to manage a count of available slots for nodes as you parse the string."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the serialized string, keep track of how many valid child slots you have. When you see a non-null node, you can fill two slots (one for each child), and when you see a null node, you fill one slot."

      "content": "Consider using a counter to represent the number of available slots for children. Initialize it to 1 (the root node), and update it as you process each value in the string."

      "content": "Consider how you will handle the input string. You can split the string by commas to process each value individually. This will help you manage the serialization step by step."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your logic accounts for all nodes and their relationships correctly. If you can maintain the slot count accurately through the entire string, you should be able to determine if the serialization is valid."
