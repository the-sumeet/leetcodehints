      "content": "Start by understanding the bitwise AND operation. The result of `a & b` is non-zero if there is at least one bit position where both `a` and `b` have a 1. This means that for three numbers to AND to zero, they must not share any bit positions where they both have a 1."

      "content": "Consider how many indices you need to choose from the array. You are looking for triples (i, j, k), which means you will be selecting three indices from the array. Remember that the same index can be used multiple times in a single triple."

      "content": "Think about how to iterate through all possible triples. You can use three nested loops to generate all combinations of indices (i, j, k). This will help you evaluate the AND condition for each combination."
