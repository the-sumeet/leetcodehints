      "content": "Start by understanding the definition of a 'nice' subarray. A subarray is considered nice if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements in it is 0. This means that for any two numbers in the subarray, they must not share any bits in common."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the bitwise AND operation works. For example, if you have two numbers, `a` and `b`, the condition `a & b = 0` means that there are no positions where both `a` and `b` have a 1 in their binary representation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently check pairs of elements in a subarray. A brute-force approach would involve checking every pair, but that could be too slow for large arrays. Instead, consider how you might use a sliding window technique to maintain a valid subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, maintain a window defined by two pointers. The left pointer represents the start of the current subarray, while the right pointer expands the subarray. This way, you can dynamically check if the current subarray remains nice as you add new elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "To check if adding a new element to your current subarray keeps it nice, you can keep track of the bitwise OR of all elements in the current subarray. If the bitwise AND of this OR with the new element is 0, then the new element can be added."
    },
    {
      "content": "When expanding your window with the right pointer, if the condition fails (i.e., the subarray is no longer nice), you will need to move the left pointer to shrink the window until it becomes nice again."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep track of the maximum length of any nice subarray you find during your iteration. This can be done by comparing the current length of the nice subarray to a variable that stores the maximum length found so far."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as arrays with only one element or arrays where all elements are the same. Remember that subarrays of length 1 are always considered nice."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the constraints properly. The input array can have up to 100,000 elements, and each element can be as large as 1 billion. Your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits of these constraints."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the length of the longest nice subarray. You should return an integer that represents this length, ensuring you have handled all possible cases correctly."
