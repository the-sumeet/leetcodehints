      "content": "Consider the difference between `s1` and `s2`. Identify the positions where the bits differ. This will help you understand how many operations you need to perform to make the strings equal."

      "content": "When you have a sequence of mismatches, think about how you can use the second operation (flipping adjacent bits) to minimize costs. If two mismatches are adjacent, it may be cheaper to flip them together."
