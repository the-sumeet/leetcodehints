      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to count the number of distinct integers in every subarray of a given length. Remember that subarrays are continuous segments of the original array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can generate all subarrays of a specific length from the input array. For an array of length n and a subarray length k, you will have n - k + 1 possible subarrays."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently count distinct elements in a subarray. A naive approach would involve using a set, but this can be inefficient if you recalculate for overlapping subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "To optimize your solution, consider using a sliding window technique. As you move the window from one subarray to the next, you can update your count of distinct numbers incrementally."

      "content": "When using a sliding window, keep track of the elements that enter and leave the window. You might use a hash map or dictionary to maintain the counts of each element."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the array length is less than the specified subarray length. In such cases, you should return an empty result or handle it gracefully."

      "content": "Consider the possibility of duplicate elements in the input array. Your solution should correctly identify distinct numbers even when there are many duplicates."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you will store the results of distinct counts for each subarray. You might want to use a list to collect these counts as you iterate through the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the final output should be a list of integers, where each integer represents the count of distinct numbers in each subarray of the specified length."

    {
      "content": "You are almost there! Implement the sliding window approach, ensuring you update your counts correctly as you slide the window across the array. Pay special attention to adding and removing elements from your count structure."
