      "content": "Start by understanding the activation process. You can only activate an element if the number of currently active elements is strictly less than its corresponding limit. This means that the order of activation can significantly affect the total value you can achieve."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the limits interact with each other. If you activate an element and it causes other elements to become inactive, think about how that affects your future choices. This is crucial for maximizing your total value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try sorting the elements based on their limits. This can help you visualize which elements can be activated earlier without causing too many elements to become inactive later on."
    },
    {
      "content": "When choosing an element to activate, prioritize those with high values but also consider their limits. A high value with a low limit might not be the best choice if it leads to deactivating other high-value elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases: What happens when all elements have the same limit? Or when the limits are all very high? These scenarios can help you identify patterns in your activation strategy."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to simulate the activation process. Keep track of the currently active elements and the total value as you activate elements in different orders. This can give you insights into which orders yield the best results."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach where you always activate the element with the highest value that can currently be activated. However, be cautious about the limits of other elements that may become inactive as a result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement a mechanism to track which elements become inactive after each activation. This could involve maintaining a list or set of active elements and checking their limits against the current count of active elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you approach the final solution, think about how to efficiently calculate the maximum total. You may need to iterate through possible activation orders and keep track of the maximum value found."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, remember to return the total value as specified in the problem statement. Ensure that your implementation handles all edge cases and adheres to the constraints provided."
