    {
      "content": "Next, focus on converting n^2 to its hexadecimal representation. Hexadecimal uses base 16, which means it includes digits from 0-9 and letters A-F. You can use built-in functions in many programming languages to perform this conversion."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the hexadecimal conversion, consider how you can represent numbers greater than 9. For example, the number 10 in hexadecimal is represented as 'A'. Make sure to test your conversion with a few examples."

    {
      "content": "Now, let's move on to converting n^3 to its hexatrigesimal representation. Hexatrigesimal is base 36, which uses digits 0-9 and letters A-Z. Similar to hexadecimal, you might find built-in functions helpful here as well."
    },
    {
      "content": "When converting to hexatrigesimal, remember that the letters A-Z represent values from 10 to 35. For instance, the value 35 corresponds to 'Z'. Make sure your conversion logic accounts for these mappings correctly."

    {
      "content": "After you have both conversions, the next step is to concatenate the two results. Ensure that you are properly joining the hexadecimal string and the hexatrigesimal string without any additional characters in between."

      "content": "Consider edge cases when n is at its minimum (1) and maximum (1000). For n=1, both n^2 and n^3 will be small, and for n=1000, you will need to ensure your code can handle larger numbers without performance issues."

      "content": "Make sure to test your function with the provided sample test cases, as well as some additional cases you create. This will help you verify that your conversion functions are working correctly."

    {
      "content": "If you encounter any issues with your outputs, double-check your conversion logic for both hexadecimal and hexatrigesimal. Pay attention to the character mappings and ensure you are not mixing up bases."

      "content": "Finally, once you have both strings and they are concatenated correctly, return the final result. Remember that the expected output format is a single string combining both representations."
