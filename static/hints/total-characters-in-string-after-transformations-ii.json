      "content": "Start by understanding how the transformation works. Each character in the string `s` is replaced by a sequence of characters based on the `nums` array. For example, if `s[i] = 'a'` and `nums[0] = 3`, it transforms to 'bcd'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the transformation wraps around the alphabet. If a character exceeds 'z', it should continue from 'a'. For instance, 'y' with `nums[24] = 3` transforms to 'zab'."

      "content": "Note that the transformations are applied `t` times. This means that after the first transformation, the resulting string is used as the input for the next transformation."

      "content": "Think about how the length of the string changes with each transformation. Each character can potentially expand into multiple characters based on the `nums` values."

    {
      "content": "You should keep track of how the length of the string evolves after each transformation. For example, if a character expands into `k` characters, the total length increases by `k - 1`."

    {
      "content": "Since `t` can be very large (up to 10^9), directly simulating each transformation is impractical. Consider how you might calculate the length after `t` transformations without explicitly building the intermediate strings."

      "content": "Explore the idea of how transformations can be represented mathematically. For each character, you can compute the total number of characters it will produce after `t` transformations."

      "content": "Think about using a loop to calculate the effective transformation length for each character in the string. You might want to store the current length and update it based on the transformations."

    {
      "content": "Remember to apply the modulo operation (10^9 + 7) to keep the length manageable and to meet the problem's requirements for large outputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `t = 0`. In this case, the length of the resulting string should simply be the length of the original string `s`."

      "content": "What happens if `nums[i]` is at its maximum value? Think about how this impacts the growth of the string length. Each character could potentially expand significantly."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the new length after transformations, remember to account for the cumulative effect of transformations. Each character's contribution to the length can be influenced by previous transformations."

      "content": "You might want to create a helper function to compute the length contribution of a single character after `t` transformations. This can help simplify your main logic."

      "content": "As you build your solution, consider the overall time complexity. Aim for a solution that efficiently handles the maximum constraints without excessive computations."
