      "content": "Consider how many times each element from `nums1` will be paired with elements from `nums2`. If `nums1` has length `m` and `nums2` has length `n`, each element in `nums1` will be paired with every element in `nums2`, resulting in `m * n` total pairings."

    {
      "content": "Think about the final result you need to compute: the XOR of all values in the resulting array `nums3`. You can leverage the properties of XOR to simplify your approach instead of explicitly constructing `nums3`."

      "content": "Notice that the XOR operation is commutative and associative. This means the order in which you apply XOR does not matter. You can group the terms in any way that helps you simplify the calculation."

      "content": "You can express the final XOR result as a combination of XORs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`. Specifically, for each element `x` in `nums1` and `y` in `nums2`, you can think of the contribution of `x ^ y` to the final result."

      "content": "Consider the frequency of each number in the final XOR computation. Each number from `nums1` is paired with all numbers from `nums2`, which means each number in `nums1` contributes to the final XOR `n` times (where `n` is the length of `nums2`)."

      "content": "Similarly, each number in `nums2` is paired with all numbers from `nums1`, contributing `m` times (where `m` is the length of `nums1`). Think about how this affects the overall XOR when certain counts are even or odd."

      "content": "If an element appears an even number of times in the XOR calculation, it will cancel itself out (because `x ^ x = 0`). Focus on how many times each element effectively contributes to the final result."
