      "content": "To check if the bitwise OR of two or more numbers has trailing zeros, you need to consider the binary representations of those numbers. Focus on how the LSB of the OR operation is determined."

    {
      "content": "Recall that the bitwise OR operation results in a bit being set to 1 if at least one of the corresponding bits in the operands is 1. Therefore, for the OR to have a trailing zero, at least one of the selected numbers must be even."
