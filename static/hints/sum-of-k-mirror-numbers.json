      "content": "To check if a number is palindromic, you can convert it to a string and compare it to its reverse. For example, in Python: `str(num) == str(num)[::-1]`."

      "content": "When converting to base-k, remember that you repeatedly divide the number by k and keep track of the remainders. The remainders form the digits of the number in base-k."
