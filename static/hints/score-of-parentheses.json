    {
      "content": "Consider how you can break down the problem. If you have a string like '(A)', how does that relate to the score of A? Remember, the score of '(A)' is 2 times the score of A."
    },
    {
      "content": "Look for patterns in the examples provided. For instance, in the string '(())', you can think of it as '(A)' where A is '()'. How would you calculate the score step by step?"

      "content": "Think about how to handle concatenated strings like '()()'. You need to calculate the score of each part separately and then sum them up. What would be the score of each part?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to use a stack to help manage the parentheses. When you encounter a '(', you can push a marker onto the stack, and when you find a ')', you can pop from the stack and calculate scores."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as the smallest valid input '()' and how the score is calculated. What happens if you have multiple pairs like '()()' or nested pairs like '((()))'?"

      "content": "Think about how to implement the logic in code. You can iterate through the string and use a stack or a simple counter to keep track of the score as you parse through the characters."

      "content": "As a final step, ensure your implementation correctly returns the final score after processing the entire string. What will you do to finalize the score once you've parsed all characters?"
