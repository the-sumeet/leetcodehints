    },
    {
      "content": "Next, think about how to determine if one cuboid can be placed on top of another. You need to check if the width, length, and height of the top cuboid are all less than or equal to those of the bottom cuboid."

    {
      "content": "Consider sorting the cuboids. If you sort them by width, length, and height, it may simplify the process of checking which cuboid can be placed on another. Sorting can help in reducing the number of comparisons you need to make."

    {
      "content": "When sorting, remember to sort by all three dimensions. A good approach is to sort by width first, then by length, and finally by height. This way, you can ensure that each cuboid is placed in a valid order."

      "content": "After sorting, you can use dynamic programming to compute the maximum height of the stacked cuboids. Create an array where each index represents the maximum height achievable with the cuboid at that index at the base."

    {
      "content": "Initialize your DP array with the heights of the cuboids themselves. This means that if a cuboid is placed alone, the height of the stack is just its own height."

      "content": "Remember that the dimensions of the cuboids are limited to a maximum of 100. This means that your solution should be efficient enough to handle the worst-case scenario within reasonable time limits."

      "content": "As you implement the solution, consider using a nested loop for the DP updates. The outer loop will iterate through each cuboid, while the inner loop checks all previous cuboids for stacking possibilities."
