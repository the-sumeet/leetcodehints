    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can compare elements from the two arrays. Do you need to consider the order of elements, or just their values? This will help you determine if you are looking for unique pairs or if duplicates matter."

      "content": "Consider the size of the arrays. What happens if one array is significantly larger than the other? How might that affect your approach to counting pairs?"
