    "You need to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements in a chosen subarray equal.",
    "An operation consists of incrementing or decrementing an element by 1.",
    "You may need to consider all possible subarrays, which could lead to O(n^2) complexity.",
    "The input array can contain both positive and negative integers.",
    "The result should be a single integer representing the minimum operations needed."
