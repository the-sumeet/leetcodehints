    {
      "content": "Remember that the operation `shift(c, x)` takes a character `c` and a digit `x`, returning the character that is `x` positions after `c`. Think about how you can calculate this in terms of ASCII values."
    },
    {
      "content": "To implement the `shift` function, you can convert the character to its ASCII value using `ord(c)`, add the integer value of the digit, and then convert it back to a character using `chr()`. For example: `shift(c, x) = chr(ord(c) + x)`."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating through the string, focus on the odd indices. For each odd index `i`, you will need to use the character at index `i-1` (which is guaranteed to be a letter) and the digit at index `i` to perform the shift operation."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as the minimum length of the string. If the string has only one character, you won't have any digits to replace, so your function should handle this gracefully."
