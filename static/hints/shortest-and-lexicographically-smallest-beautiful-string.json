      "content": "Consider how you can efficiently find all substrings of the binary string. A nested loop could be a straightforward approach where you check all possible substrings, but think about how you can optimize this."

      "content": "When iterating over substrings, maintain a count of '1's. You can use a sliding window approach to avoid recalculating counts for overlapping parts of the string."

      "content": "As you find substrings that contain exactly 'k' '1's, keep track of their lengths. You want to find the shortest length among these beautiful substrings."

      "content": "Once you have identified the shortest length of beautiful substrings, you need to filter out those substrings that match this length. This will help you narrow down your candidates for the final result."

      "content": "To ensure you find the lexicographically smallest substring, you can utilize a list or a set to store candidates and then sort them, or you can compare substrings directly as you find them."

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when the string does not contain any '1's at all. In such cases, you should return an empty string."

      "content": "Be cautious about the constraints. The length of the string can go up to 100, so ensure your solution is efficient enough to handle the upper limits without timing out."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep track of both the shortest length and the smallest substring simultaneously. This can help you avoid unnecessary comparisons later."
    },

      "content": "Finally, ensure your return format is correct. You should return the lexicographically smallest beautiful substring of the shortest length found, or an empty string if no such substring exists."
