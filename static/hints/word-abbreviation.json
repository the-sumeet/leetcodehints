      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to create abbreviations for a list of words such that each abbreviation is unique. Consider how an abbreviation is formed by taking the first letter, the number of characters between the first and last letter, and the last letter."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent an abbreviation for a word like 'internet'. The abbreviation could be 'i6t', where '6' is the count of letters between 'i' and 't'. What about shorter words? How will their abbreviations differ?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as words that are very short (like 'me' or 'aa'). How would you handle abbreviating these words? You may need to define a minimum length for abbreviations."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you create abbreviations, ensure that they are unique. If two words produce the same abbreviation, you will need to adjust one or both of them. Think about how you can track which abbreviations have already been used."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a dictionary or a set to keep track of the abbreviations you've generated. This will help you quickly check for uniqueness as you iterate through the list of words."
    },
    {
      "content": "When generating abbreviations, consider the order of words. If two words are the same length and produce the same abbreviation, you will need to decide how to handle that. What rules will you apply for tie-breaking?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to implement the logic for generating abbreviations. You can start with the first letter, then count the characters in between, and finally add the last letter. Write a function to handle this for a single word."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have a function to generate abbreviations, test it with various words to ensure it behaves as expected. For example, 'like' should return 'l3e', and 'me' should return 'me' if you decide not to abbreviate it."
    },
    {
      "content": "After generating abbreviations for all words, check for conflicts. If two words have the same abbreviation, you need to modify one of them. Think about how to incrementally adjust the abbreviation to resolve conflicts."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might increment the abbreviation. One approach could be to increase the count of characters in between until you find a unique abbreviation, or you could change the last character to ensure uniqueness."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may need to iterate through your list multiple times: first to generate the initial abbreviations, and then to resolve any conflicts. Keep track of which words have been modified during this process."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle cases where all possible abbreviations are exhausted. For instance, if you have a word like 'face', and all its abbreviations are taken, consider returning the word itself as the abbreviation."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you finalize your solution, ensure that your output format matches the requirements. You need to return a list of abbreviations corresponding to the input list of words."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before you finish, think about the performance of your solution. If the input list is very large, how will your approach scale? Consider the time complexity of generating and checking abbreviations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Now, put together all the pieces: generate abbreviations, check for uniqueness, resolve conflicts, and return the final list. Make sure to test your solution with edge cases and larger inputs to verify its correctness."
