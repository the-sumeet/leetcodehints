      "content": "Start by understanding the game mechanics. The player starts with a certain amount of health and must navigate through a series of challenges represented by an array of integers. Each integer represents the health points required to beat that challenge."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the player's health interacts with the challenges. If the player's health is less than the challenge value, they will lose health points. If the health is equal to or greater than the challenge value, they can proceed without losing health."

      "content": "Think about how to calculate the minimum health needed to survive through all challenges. You might want to iterate through the array of challenges and keep track of the health needed at each step."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the challenges, you can maintain a variable that tracks the total health needed. If the current health is less than the challenge value, you need to determine how much more health is required."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle cases where the player's initial health is already sufficient to beat all challenges. In such cases, the minimum health required would be zero."

      "content": "When calculating the required health, make sure to account for the cumulative effect of multiple challenges. For example, if the player loses health in one challenge, it might affect their ability to face subsequent challenges."

      "content": "You might want to use a loop to go through each challenge and a conditional statement to check if the current health is sufficient. Keep updating the minimum health needed based on the challenges faced."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to structure your function. You will need to take in the challenges array and return a single integer representing the minimum health required. Make sure to return the correct format as specified."

      "content": "As a final step, ensure that your function handles all edge cases correctly, including negative numbers in the challenges array or very large numbers. Consider how these might affect your calculations."
