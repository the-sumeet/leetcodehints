      "content": "Think about how many substrings can be formed from a segment of consecutive '1's. If you have a segment of length `n`, how many substrings can you form from it? Consider counting substrings of lengths 1 to n."

      "content": "For a segment of '1's of length `n`, the number of substrings can be calculated using the formula: `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This accounts for all possible lengths of substrings that can be formed."
