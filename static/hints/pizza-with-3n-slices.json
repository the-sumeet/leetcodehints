      "content": "Consider the total number of slices. Since the length of the slices array is always 3n, think about how many slices you can actually pick. You can pick n slices in total."

    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of your choice. If you pick a slice, both Alice and Bob will take slices adjacent to your choice. This means the strategy involves not just maximizing your current pick, but also minimizing the potential picks for Alice and Bob."

      "content": "Try to visualize the problem with a smaller example. For example, with slices = [1, 2, 3], you can see how the picking order works and how it affects the outcome."

      "content": "You might want to use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Consider defining a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the maximum sum you can achieve by picking j slices from the first i slices."

    {
      "content": "When defining your DP state, think about the choices you have. If you pick the i-th slice, what are the implications for the next slices you can pick? You will need to skip certain slices to account for Alice and Bob's picks."

      "content": "Remember that you can only pick n slices. This means you need to keep track of how many slices you have picked so far in your DP solution."

    {
      "content": "Think about the circular nature of the pizza. If you pick a slice near the end of the array, it affects the slices at the beginning of the array due to the circular arrangement."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you build your DP solution, ensure you handle the circular nature of the slices correctly. You might need to consider two scenarios: picking from the first slice to the last slice, and picking from the second slice to the last slice."

    {
      "content": "When filling out your DP table, remember to consider both cases when you pick a slice: the slice you pick and the slices that will be unavailable due to Alice and Bob's picks."
    },
    {
      "content": "To maximize your sum, you should explore all possible starting points for your picks. This means iterating through the slices and calculating the maximum sum for each possible starting slice."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to implement the logic for skipping slices correctly. If you pick slice i, you cannot pick slices i-1 and i+1 in the next round, which affects how you fill your DP table."

    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your DP approach, write down the recurrence relation based on your observations. This will help clarify how to transition between states in your DP table."
