      "content": "Consider what it means to connect all cities with minimum cost. This is a classic problem that can be solved using Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithms. Have you heard of Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm?"

    {
      "content": "If you choose to use Kruskal's algorithm, remember that you'll need to sort the edges by their weights. This will help you to pick the smallest edges first. What data structure might you use to keep track of the connected components?"

    "Input consists of an integer representing the number of cities and a list of edges with costs.",
    "Cities are indexed starting from 1, so be mindful of 0-based vs 1-based indexing.",
    "The edges may contain duplicate connections; consider only the minimum cost for each pair.",
    "Return the total cost of connecting all cities, or specify how to handle cases where not all cities can be connected."
