    {
      "content": "Remember that the scores in the matrix are distinct integers. This means that there will be no ties when sorting students based on their scores in the `k`-th exam."

      "content": "Consider how you will extract the scores from the `k`-th column for each student. You can use a list comprehension or a loop to gather these scores into a separate list."

      "content": "Think about how to sort the students based on their `k`-th exam scores. You might want to use a sorting function that allows you to specify a custom key for sorting."
    },
    {
      "content": "When sorting, remember that you want the highest scores to come first. This means you need to sort in descending order. Be sure to check the sorting function's parameters for this."

    {
      "content": "You can use Python's `sorted()` function with a lambda function as the key. For example: `sorted(score, key=lambda x: x[k], reverse=True)` will sort the students based on their `k`-th scores in descending order."

      "content": "After sorting, ensure that you return the entire matrix in the new sorted order. The output format should still be a 2D list representing the students and their scores."
