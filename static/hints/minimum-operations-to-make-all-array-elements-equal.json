      "content": "Consider how to calculate the number of operations needed for each element in `nums` to reach a specific query value. For an element `num[i]` and a query `q`, the operations needed can be calculated as `|num[i] - q|`."

      "content": "To handle multiple queries efficiently, think about how you can reset the array to its original state after each query. This means you will need to compute the operations for each query independently."

      "content": "Since the maximum size for `nums` and `queries` can be quite large (up to 100,000), consider the time complexity of your approach. A naive solution that checks each element for every query might lead to a time complexity of O(n * m), which could be inefficient."
