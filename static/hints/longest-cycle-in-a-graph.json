      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the graph. Each node points to at most one other node, and some nodes might not point anywhere (indicated by -1). This means you can visualize the graph as a collection of chains and cycles."

      "content": "Consider how to traverse the graph. A depth-first search (DFS) or iterative approach might be useful to explore each node and its connections. Remember to keep track of visited nodes to avoid redundant work."

      "content": "When traversing, maintain a record of the path you take. You can use a stack or a list to store the nodes you've visited in the current traversal. This will help you identify cycles."

      "content": "Think about how to detect a cycle. If you revisit a node that is already in your current path, you've found a cycle. The length of the cycle can be calculated based on the position of the first occurrence of that node in your path."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle nodes that point to -1 correctly. These nodes do not contribute to cycles, so you can skip them during your traversal."

      "content": "As you traverse, you might want to mark nodes as visited. Use a separate array or set to track which nodes have already been processed to prevent infinite loops."
