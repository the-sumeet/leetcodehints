      "content": "Consider the placement rules: a box can only be placed on top of another box if that box is fully supported on all four sides. This means that the bottom box must be adjacent to either the wall or another box."

      "content": "Notice that as `n` increases, the configuration of boxes can change. For `n = 3`, you can still fit all three boxes in the corner. What happens when `n = 4`?"

      "content": "As you approach the solution, think about how the arrangement of boxes can be optimized. What configurations lead to fewer boxes on the floor?"

      "content": "You can also think about the number of boxes touching the walls versus those that are stacked. How does this impact your final count?"

      "content": "For the final hint, consider that the number of boxes touching the floor will likely be a function of the square root of `n`. Can you express this relationship mathematically?"
