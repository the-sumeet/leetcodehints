      "content": "Consider how the value of the stones influences the strategy. Positive values are beneficial, while negative values can be detrimental. Think about how taking a stone might affect the opponent's options."

      "content": "Remember that both players play optimally. This means they will always choose the option that maximizes their score or minimizes the opponent's score. Think about the consequences of each move."

      "content": "You can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Define a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve starting from the `i`-th stone."

      "content": "Initialize your DP array with a size equal to the length of `stoneValue`. The base case will be when there are no stones left, which should return a score of 0."

      "content": "When calculating the score for taking stones, remember to subtract the opponent's potential score from the current player's score. This will help you determine the optimal choice."

      "content": "After filling the DP array, the final score difference can be found at `dp[0]`. This value will help you determine whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or if it's a tie."

    {
      "content": "Remember to interpret the score difference correctly. If `dp[0] > 0`, Alice wins; if `dp[0] < 0`, Bob wins; and if `dp[0] == 0`, it's a tie."
