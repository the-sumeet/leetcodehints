      "content": "Consider the properties of a sorted array. If you take any subarray, it should ideally be in non-decreasing order. Identify the boundaries of the sliding window and how they affect the elements within it."

      "content": "For each sliding window, check the elements inside it. You can use a loop to iterate through the array and extract the elements of the current window. This will help you analyze the order of the elements."

      "content": "Think about how to determine the smallest subarray that needs sorting. You might want to find the first and last out-of-order elements within the current window. This will help you identify the boundaries of the subarray."

      "content": "When checking for out-of-order elements, remember to compare each element with its neighbors. If an element is greater than the next one, it is out of order. Keep track of the indices of these elements."

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently check each sliding window. Instead of sorting the entire array multiple times, can you maintain a sorted state or use a data structure that helps you keep track of order?"
