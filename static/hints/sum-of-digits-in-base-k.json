      "content": "Remember that the digits in base k will be obtained in reverse order. So, after you collect the remainders, you may need to reverse them to get the correct representation of the number in base k."

      "content": "After summing the digits, ensure that your final result is returned in base 10. This is straightforward since you've been working with base 10 numbers throughout the summation process."
