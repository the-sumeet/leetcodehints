      "content": "Consider how you will represent the available and used phone numbers. A simple approach could involve using a list or an array to keep track of the numbers and their availability."

    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints on the phone numbers. For instance, if the directory size is 3, the valid phone numbers will range from 0 to 2. Make sure to account for this when implementing your logic."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the `get` operation, ensure that it returns an available number and marks it as used. You might want to maintain a set or a similar structure to track which numbers are currently in use."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the `check` operation, you need to verify if a specific number is available. This can be done by checking your data structure that tracks used numbers."

      "content": "The `release` operation should allow a previously used number to be marked as available again. Think about how you will update your data structure to reflect this change."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as trying to get a number when all numbers are currently in use. What should your method return in this case? You might want to return -1 or some indication of unavailability."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The Phone Directory should handle a fixed number of phone numbers, ranging from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of the directory.",
    "Ensure that the `get` method returns -1 if no numbers are available.",
    "The `check` method should return a boolean indicating whether the number is available.",
    "The `release` method should allow a number to be reused, and it should only be called on numbers that are currently in use."
