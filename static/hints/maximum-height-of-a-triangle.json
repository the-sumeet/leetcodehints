The total number of balls needed for a triangle of height `h` is the sum of the first `h` natural numbers: `1 + 2 + ... + h = h * (h + 1) / 2`."

      "content": "Remember that the balls in each row must be of the same color, and adjacent rows must be of different colors. This means you need to alternate colors as you build the triangle."

      "content": "Consider the maximum height of the triangle you can build with the given counts of red and blue balls. You can only use a certain number of balls from each color for each row, so think about how to balance the two colors."

      "content": "To find the maximum height, you can use a loop to incrementally test each height `h`, checking if you have enough balls of each color to fill the rows up to that height."

      "content": "For each height `h`, calculate the number of balls needed for the rows of each color. For example, if `h` is odd, the rows will require more of one color than the other. Make sure to account for this when checking if you have enough balls."

      "content": "You can use a simple formula to determine how many balls are needed for each color based on whether `h` is odd or even. For example, if `h` is odd, the red balls might need to fill more rows than the blue balls."
