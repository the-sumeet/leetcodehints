      "content": "Notice that the popcount-depth is defined as the number of steps it takes to reach 1. If you start with a number and apply popcount, keep track of how many steps it takes to get to 1."

      "content": "To find the number of integers with a specific popcount-depth, you could iterate through all integers from 1 to n and calculate their popcount-depth. However, this may not be efficient for large n."

    {
      "content": "Think about how the popcount function reduces the size of the number. Each time you apply popcount, the number typically decreases. This means the sequence will not be very long for larger numbers."
