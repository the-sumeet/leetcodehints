      "content": "Start by understanding the basic operations you can use: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (*), and division (/). Each of these will affect how you can reach the target number from the given integer x."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the order of operations. Remember that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction. This will influence how you structure your expressions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can combine operations to reach the target. For example, if your target is much larger than x, multiplication might be a key operation to use."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to express the target in terms of x. For instance, if x = 3 and your target is 19, think about how many times you can multiply or add 3 to get close to 19."

    {
      "content": "Explore the idea of using multiplication to build up to larger numbers. For example, if you need to reach a number like 1000, consider how many times you can multiply x to get there."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that division can be used to fine-tune your results. If you overshoot your target with multiplication, see if dividing by x can help you adjust downwards."

    {
      "content": "When constructing your expression, keep track of the number of operators you use. Your goal is to minimize this count, so think strategically about each operation."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the target is equal to x. In this scenario, you won't need any operations at all, which means the answer would be 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "If the target is less than x, think about how you can reach it using subtraction or division. For example, if x = 5 and your target is 1, you could use 5 / 5."

      "content": "Use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to explore different combinations of operations. This can help you systematically find the least number of operators needed."

      "content": "Keep in mind that you may encounter multiple ways to reach the same target. Focus on finding the one that uses the least operators."

      "content": "Be aware of potential overflow issues when dealing with large numbers. Ensure that your operations stay within the bounds of the problem constraints."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you find a way to reach the target, check if you can improve your solution by reducing the number of operators. This iterative refinement can lead to a better solution."
