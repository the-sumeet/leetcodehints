      "content": "Think about how you can represent the items and their costs. A simple list or array of item prices could be a good start. How would you structure this data?"

      "content": "Consider the maximum amount of money you can spend. This will help you filter out items that are too expensive to buy. What happens if an item costs more than your total budget?"
