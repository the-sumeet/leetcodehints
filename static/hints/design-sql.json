    {
      "content": "Start by understanding the operations you need to implement: `ins`, `sel`, `exp`, and `rmv`. Each operation corresponds to inserting, selecting, expanding, and removing elements from a collection. Make sure you clarify how each operation affects the state of your data."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will store your data. A list or a dictionary might be suitable depending on how you plan to access and modify the elements. Think about the implications of using each structure, especially for the `sel` and `exp` operations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the indexing of elements. In programming, indexing typically starts at 0, but make sure you check if the problem specifies a different starting index for the operations. This will affect how you access elements during selection and expansion."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing the `ins` operation, remember that it can take a list of new elements to be added. You need to ensure that these elements are appended correctly to the existing collection. Consider how to handle cases where the collection may already contain elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the `sel` operation, think about how you will return the selected elements. You may need to handle cases where the requested indices are out of bounds or if the selection is empty. Make sure to return an appropriate response in such cases."
    },
    {
      "content": "The `exp` operation should expand the currently selected elements. Clarify how you will define 'currently selected' and how you will manage the state of your selections. This could involve maintaining a separate list of selected indices."
    },
    {
      "content": "During the `rmv` operation, consider how to handle the removal of elements. If an index is specified, ensure that you check if it is valid before attempting to remove an element. Think about what happens if the collection becomes empty after a removal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your implementation with edge cases, such as trying to select or remove elements from an empty collection, or inserting elements at various positions. This will help ensure your code is robust and handles unexpected inputs gracefully."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing the `ins` operation, consider how to handle inserting multiple elements at once. You may need to adjust the indices of existing elements in your collection accordingly. Think about whether to insert at the beginning, end, or a specific index."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, structure your code to handle each operation in a clear and organized manner. You might want to create separate functions for each operation to keep your code modular. Ensure that each function properly updates the state of your collection after performing its task."
