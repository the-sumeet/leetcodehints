      "content": "When parsing the equation, pay attention to the signs ('+' and '-') that precede the coefficients of 'x'. This will affect how you accumulate the total coefficients of 'x'."

    {
      "content": "As you parse, keep track of two sums: one for the coefficients of 'x' and another for the constant terms. For example, if you encounter '2x' or 'x', remember to add 2 or 1 to your 'x' coefficient, respectively."

      "content": "Consider the different scenarios based on the values of A and B: If A is 0 and B is also 0, there are infinite solutions. If A is 0 and B is not 0, there is no solution. Otherwise, there is a unique solution."

      "content": "When you find a unique solution, ensure you format the output correctly as 'x=#value'. Remember that the problem guarantees that if there is a single solution, it will be an integer."

      "content": "Be cautious with edge cases, such as when the equation simplifies to something trivial like 'x=x'. This should lead you to recognize infinite solutions."
