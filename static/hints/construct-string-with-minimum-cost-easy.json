      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to construct a string using the given segments from the list, ensuring that the total cost is minimized. Think about how the segments can overlap or connect."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the input string and the segments. Identify how the segments can be used to cover parts of the string. For example, if the string is 'abcdef', which segments can cover 'abc', 'def', or other parts?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Check for overlaps between segments. If two segments can cover the same part of the string, you need to choose the one with the lower cost. Think about how you can represent this relationship."
    },
    {
      "content": "Create a mapping of segments to their costs. This will help you quickly access the cost associated with each segment when deciding which to use. Use a dictionary or similar structure for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to traverse the input string. You might want to use a greedy approach where you always pick the cheapest segment that can cover the next part of the string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there are segments that do not overlap at all or when the input string is very short. How will your approach handle these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When selecting segments, keep track of the indices in the string that you have covered. This will help ensure you do not select segments that overlap incorrectly."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a dynamic programming approach. Define a DP array where each index represents the minimum cost to construct the string up to that index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you fill in your DP array, remember to check all possible segments that can end at each index. Update the cost based on the minimum found so far for that segment."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution handles the case where the entire string cannot be constructed from the segments. Decide what to return in such cases, like -1 or some indication of failure."

    "Segments can overlap, and you must choose the one with the minimum cost.",
