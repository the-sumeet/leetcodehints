    "The input is a list of words, and you need to find the shortest distance between two specific words.",
    "The words can be the same, so handle that case carefully by checking different occurrences.",
    "You must return the minimum distance as an integer.",
    "If either word is not present in the list, you should define the behavior (e.g., return -1 or some error value)."
