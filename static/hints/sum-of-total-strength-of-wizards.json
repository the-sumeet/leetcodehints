      "content": "Consider how you would generate all possible contiguous subarrays from the given array. You can use two nested loops to achieve this. For example, for an array of length n, you can iterate with an outer loop from 0 to n-1 and an inner loop from the current index to n."

    {
      "content": "When iterating through subarrays, remember to calculate both the minimum strength and the sum of strengths for each subarray. You can keep track of the minimum strength using a variable that updates as you expand your subarray."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently compute the sum of strengths for each subarray. Instead of recalculating the sum from scratch for each subarray, you can maintain a running total that adds the next element as you expand the subarray."

      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. The length of the strength array can be up to 100,000, which means your solution needs to be efficient. O(n^2) solutions may not be feasible."

      "content": "As you compute the total strength for each subarray, remember to take the modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent overflow and meet the problem's requirements."

      "content": "When calculating the contributions of each wizard's strength to the total strength, consider how many subarrays a particular strength is the minimum for. This can drastically reduce the number of calculations."

      "content": "Make sure to handle the modulo operation correctly throughout your calculations to avoid integer overflow. This is particularly important when summing large numbers."
