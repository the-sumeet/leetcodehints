      "content": "Consider the properties of sorted arrays. Since both arrays are sorted, you can leverage this to optimize your search for common elements. Think about how you can traverse both arrays simultaneously."

      "content": "You might want to use two pointers, one for each array. Initialize both pointers at the start of their respective arrays and compare the elements they point to. If they are equal, move both pointers forward."

    {
      "content": "If the elements at both pointers are not equal, you need to decide which pointer to move. Remember that the arrays are sorted, so you should move the pointer that points to the smaller element to try to find a match."

      "content": "Keep track of the common elements you find as you traverse the arrays. You can use a list to store these elements. Be sure to only add elements to this list when both pointers point to equal values."
