      "content": "To solve this problem, think about how you can track the frequency of digits in the substring. You might want to use a frequency array or a hash map to count occurrences of each digit (0-9)."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the string, maintain a count of the current substring's character frequencies. This will help you determine if the substring can be rearranged into a palindrome."

      "content": "You can use a bitmask to represent the parity (even or odd count) of each digit's frequency. Each bit in the bitmask can represent whether the count of a digit is odd or even."

      "content": "Don't forget to check for substrings that can be formed by changing one digit's parity. To do this, you can try toggling each bit of the current bitmask and checking for its existence in your dictionary."
