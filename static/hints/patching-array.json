      "content": "Notice that the array is sorted. This property can help you efficiently determine which numbers can be formed with the current elements."

      "content": "If the smallest number you need to form (let's call it 'currentSum') is less than or equal to the first element of the array, you will need to patch it. Why is that?"

      "content": "When you add a patch, it effectively increases the range of sums you can form. Think about how adding a number can help cover gaps in the range."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, keep track of the currentSum. If the currentSum is greater than the next number in the array, you can use that number to form new sums."
