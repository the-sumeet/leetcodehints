    {
      "content": "You need to ensure that the function continues to call `fn` every `t` milliseconds until the cancel function is invoked. Consider using a recursive approach with `setTimeout` for this."

      "content": "Your final implementation should look something like this: Create the cancellable function, call `fn`, set up the interval using `setTimeout`, and ensure to return the cancel function that stops the process."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The function `fn` is guaranteed to be a valid function.",
    "The `args` array is a valid JSON array with a length between 1 and 10.",
    "The interval `t` is between 30 and 100 milliseconds.",
    "The cancellation time must be between 10 and 500 milliseconds."
