      "content": "If you decide to use a split method, be aware of how it handles consecutive spaces. For instance, splitting 'Hello  world' should give you two segments, not three."

      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, test it against a variety of cases, including strings with only spaces, strings with punctuation, and strings with mixed characters. This will help ensure your solution is robust."

      "content": "You are very close to the solution! To finalize, implement the logic to count segments based on your chosen method, whether itâ€™s using split or a manual iteration. Remember to return the count of segments as an integer."
