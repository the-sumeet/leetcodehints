      "content": "For S_n, the length can be derived as: len(S_n) = 2 * len(S_(n-1)) + 1. This means you can find the length of S_n without building the entire string, which is crucial for larger values of n."

      "content": "Consider the position k in S_n. If k is less than or equal to the length of S_(n-1), then the k-th bit is simply in S_(n-1). If k equals the length of S_(n-1) + 1, the bit is '1'."

      "content": "When you're looking for the k-th bit in the inverted part, remember that you need to invert the bit you find. If you find a '0', it becomes '1', and vice versa."
