      "content": "Consider how you can use bitwise operations to ask questions about the number. For instance, asking if a number is even or odd can be done using the bitwise AND operation: `number & 1`."

      "content": "Think about how you can narrow down the possible values of the number with each question. Each question you ask should ideally halve the search space. This is similar to a binary search approach."
