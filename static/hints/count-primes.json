      "content": "Consider the edge cases: What happens when n = 0 or n = 1? Both cases should return 0 because there are no prime numbers less than these values."

      "content": "One efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to a certain number is the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This algorithm allows you to find all prime numbers less than n in a time complexity of O(n log log n)."
