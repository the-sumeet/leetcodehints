      "content": "To find where a square lands, you need to check all previously dropped squares that it overlaps with. This means checking for any squares whose left and right edges intersect with the new square's left and right edges."

      "content": "As you check for overlaps, remember that a square only lands on another square if it is fully above it. If it only touches the side, it does not count as landing."

      "content": "Remember that the height of a square is determined by the height of the highest square it lands on plus its own height. This means you may need to keep track of heights dynamically."
