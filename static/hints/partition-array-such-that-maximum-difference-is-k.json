      "content": "Consider how you can group numbers together. What happens if you take the first number in the sorted array and keep adding numbers until you can't add any more without exceeding the difference of k?"

      "content": "Think about the properties of subsequences. Remember that a subsequence can be formed by deleting elements, but the order must remain the same. How does this affect your grouping strategy?"

      "content": "As you iterate through the sorted array, keep track of the current subsequence's minimum and maximum values. When the difference exceeds k, what should you do next? This will help you determine when to start a new subsequence."

      "content": "While iterating, maintain a count of how many subsequences you've formed. This count will be your final answer. How will you increment this count based on your grouping logic?"

      "content": "Finally, think about the overall time complexity of your approach. Sorting the array takes O(n log n), but what about the subsequent operations? Ensure your solution is efficient enough given the constraints."
