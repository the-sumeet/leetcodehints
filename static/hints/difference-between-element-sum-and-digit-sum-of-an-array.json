      "content": "To compute the digit sum, you'll need to break each number in the array into its individual digits. Consider how you might extract digits from a number. For example, for the number 15, the digits are 1 and 5."

      "content": "Remember that the digit sum involves summing all the digits across all numbers in the array. You can convert each number to a string to easily access its digits, or use mathematical operations to extract digits."

    {
      "content": "After calculating both sums, you can use the built-in function for absolute value in your programming language of choice. For example, in Python, you would use abs() to get the absolute difference."
