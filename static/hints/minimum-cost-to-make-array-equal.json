      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to make all elements in the `nums` array equal, and each operation has a different cost associated with it. Think about how the cost varies based on the target value you choose."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of choosing different target values. If you choose a target that is much larger or smaller than the current values in `nums`, the cost could be significantly higher. What range of target values makes sense?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Note that the cost of changing each element depends on the difference between that element and the target value. This means you will need to calculate the total cost for each potential target value."

      "content": "What happens if all elements in `nums` are already equal? Think about how you would handle this case to avoid unnecessary calculations."

    {
      "content": "To find the optimal target value, you might want to consider using binary search. This can help you efficiently narrow down the best target value by evaluating the cost at different points."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using binary search, think about how to define the cost function. This function should take a target value and compute the total cost required to make all elements in `nums` equal to that target."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the cost calculation correctly. For each element in `nums`, you will need to multiply the absolute difference between that element and the target by the corresponding cost from the `cost` array."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when `nums` has only one element. What would the cost be in such a scenario? This can help you validate your approach."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your solution. The constraints allow for large arrays, so your approach should ideally be better than O(n^2). How can binary search help you achieve this?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing the binary search, remember to check both the left and right halves of your search space. This ensures that you are not missing the optimal target value."

    {
      "content": "As you implement the cost function, ensure that it handles all possible values correctly. You may want to test it with a few sample target values to ensure its accuracy."

    {
      "content": "Consider the precision of your calculations. Since costs can grow large, be careful with integer overflows in languages with fixed integer sizes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have your binary search and cost function working, try running your solution with the provided examples to see if it produces the expected results."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you would return the result. The problem specifies that you should return the minimum total cost, so ensure your final output matches this requirement."
