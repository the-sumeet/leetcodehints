      "content": "Consider the fact that multiple cars can overlap on the number line. This means that simply counting the ranges won't give you the correct number of unique points covered."

      "content": "You might want to keep track of all the points that are covered by the cars. One way to do this is by using a set to store all unique points."

      "content": "When iterating through each car's range, remember that you need to include both the start and end points. For a car defined by [start_i, end_i], you should add all points from start_i to end_i inclusive."

      "content": "As you iterate through the cars, update your array by marking the points covered by each car's range. For example, if a car covers points from 3 to 6, you would mark indices 3, 4, 5, and 6 in your array."
