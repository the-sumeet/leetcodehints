      "content": "Consider how you will group the events by `business_id`. This is crucial because you need to aggregate occurrences for each business. Think about using a dictionary or a similar data structure to store the totals."

      "content": "As you group the events, remember to sum the occurrences for the same `business_id` and `event_type`. This means you'll need to check if the event type already exists for the business when adding occurrences."
