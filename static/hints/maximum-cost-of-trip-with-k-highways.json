      "content": "Consider how you can represent the cities and highways. A graph representation (using adjacency lists or matrices) could be helpful to visualize the connections between cities and the costs associated with each highway."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints of the problem. You need to limit your path to at most K highways. This means you need to track how many highways you've used as you explore paths."

      "content": "Explore different graph traversal techniques. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) could be useful for exploring all possible paths from a starting city."

      "content": "When traversing the graph, keep track of the total cost incurred so far. You might want to maintain a running total of costs as you explore each path."

      "content": "Make sure to account for the possibility of no valid paths existing. If you can't reach any city within K highways, you should return an appropriate value (like -1 or 0)."
