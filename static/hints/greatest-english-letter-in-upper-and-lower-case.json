      "content": "Start by understanding the problem clearly. You need to find the greatest letter that appears in both lowercase and uppercase in the given string. Remember that 'A' is not the same as 'a', and you need to check for both cases."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can keep track of which letters appear in both cases. You might want to use two sets: one for lowercase letters and another for uppercase letters. This will help you identify common letters easily."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the string, check each character's case. If it's lowercase, add it to the lowercase set; if it's uppercase, add it to the uppercase set. This way, you'll have a clear record of which letters are present in both cases."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to find the intersection of the two sets you created. This intersection will give you the letters that appear in both cases. You can use set operations to achieve this efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the common letters, you need to determine which one is the greatest. Remember that in the English alphabet, 'Z' is greater than 'A', and 'a' is less than 'A'. You should convert all letters to uppercase before comparing them."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there are no letters that appear in both cases. Make sure your function can handle such cases and return an empty string as specified."

    {
      "content": "When you find the greatest letter, remember to return it in uppercase format. Even if you find a common letter in lowercase, you must convert it to uppercase before returning."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The string length can be up to 1000 characters, so your solution should be efficient enough to handle the worst-case scenario without performance issues."
    },
    {
      "content": "Test your solution with various inputs, including edge cases like strings with no common letters or strings that only contain one case of letters. This will ensure your solution is robust."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement your logic step-by-step. Start by creating the sets, then find the intersection, and finally determine the greatest letter from the intersection before returning it."
