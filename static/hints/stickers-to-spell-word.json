      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to form the target string using letters from the stickers. Each sticker can be used multiple times, and you can cut letters from them."

    {
      "content": "Consider the frequency of each letter in the target string. You can use a frequency counter to easily track how many of each letter you need to form the target."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, analyze the stickers. Create a frequency count for the letters in each sticker as well. This will help you understand how many letters you can get from each sticker."

    {
      "content": "Think about the approach you want to take. A recursive backtracking approach could be useful here, where you try to form the target by using different stickers."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you explore combinations of stickers, keep track of how many stickers you are using. You want to minimize this count, so consider using a variable to store the current count."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the target string contains letters that are not present in any of the stickers. How will you handle such cases?"

    {
      "content": "You might want to use memoization to store results of previously computed states. This can help avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency."

      "content": "When implementing your recursive function, think about the base case. What condition will indicate that you have successfully formed the target string?"

      "content": "As you iterate through stickers, remember that you can skip stickers that do not contribute any letters needed for the target. This will help reduce unnecessary calculations."

      "content": "Consider the order in which you use the stickers. Some combinations may lead to a quicker solution than others. A depth-first search (DFS) approach can be beneficial here."

      "content": "If you find that you cannot form the target with the available stickers, ensure you return -1 as specified in the problem statement."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the state of your current progress in forming the target. A bitmask or a string representation of remaining letters could be useful."

      "content": "As you build your solution, keep track of the minimum number of stickers used in a global variable. Update this variable whenever you find a valid combination."
