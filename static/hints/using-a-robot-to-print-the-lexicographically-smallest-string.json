You can either take a character from the front of string `s` and add it to string `t`, or you can take a character from the end of string `t` and write it down. This means you need to manage two strings simultaneously."

      "content": "Consider how the order of characters in `s` affects the order in which they can be written down. The goal is to produce the lexicographically smallest string, so you might want to prioritize certain characters when transferring from `s` to `t`."

      "content": "Think about using a stack-like structure for `t`. When you remove characters from `t` to write them down, the last character added to `t` will be the first one you can write. This Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior is crucial for your approach."

      "content": "As you process characters from `s`, keep track of the smallest character that can be written down next. If the character at the front of `s` is smaller than the character at the end of `t`, consider moving it to `t`."
