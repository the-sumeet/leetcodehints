      "content": "Start by understanding what a 'good' subarray is. A subarray is considered good if it contains at least `k` pairs of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `arr[i] == arr[j]`. Think about how you can count these pairs efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to count the pairs of equal elements in a subarray. For any element that appears `n` times, the number of pairs can be calculated using the formula `n * (n - 1) / 2`. This is a key insight for counting pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that a subarray is contiguous. You will need to explore all possible subarrays of the given array `nums`. Think about how you can use a sliding window technique to manage the start and end of your subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through potential subarrays, maintain a frequency count of the elements in the current subarray. This will help you determine how many pairs you have at any point in time."
    },
    {
      "content": "When expanding your subarray, update the frequency count and calculate the number of pairs. If the number of pairs is at least `k`, you have found a good subarray. Consider how to efficiently check this condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `k` is larger than the maximum possible number of pairs in any subarray. For example, if all elements are unique, no subarray can be good if `k > 0`."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to keep track of the total count of good subarrays found so far. Each time you find that a subarray meets the good condition, increment your count."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the constraints affect your approach. With `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, an `O(n^2)` solution may not be feasible. Aim for a more efficient solution, possibly `O(n log n)` or `O(n)`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to optimize the counting of pairs as you slide your window. You may want to use a hashmap to store the frequency of elements, which can help in dynamically updating the count of pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, outline your approach: Use two pointers to represent the start and end of your subarray, maintain a frequency map, and count pairs dynamically as the window expands or contracts. Make sure to return the total count of good subarrays."
