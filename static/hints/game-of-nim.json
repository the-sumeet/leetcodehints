      "content": "Focus on the structure of the heaps. Each heap can have a different number of objects. How might the number of objects in each heap affect the strategy of the game? Try to visualize a few simple scenarios with small heaps."

    {
      "content": "What happens if there is only one heap? In this case, the game is straightforward. The player can take all objects from the heap and win. Consider how this case can be a base case for your solution."

      "content": "Now think about the case with multiple heaps. If you have two heaps, what strategies can be employed? Explore the idea of making the heaps equal or forcing your opponent into a losing position."

      "content": "A key concept in Nim is the XOR operation. The winning strategy can often be determined by computing the XOR of the sizes of the heaps. What does the result of this operation tell you about the game's outcome?"

    {
      "content": "Take a look at the properties of the XOR operation. Remember that if the XOR of all heap sizes is zero, the player to move is in a losing position. How can you use this property to determine the winner?"

      "content": "When implementing your solution, think about how you will read the input and represent the heaps. Ensure that your function can handle various input formats, such as an empty list or lists of different lengths."

      "content": "As you approach the final implementation, remember to return the correct format of the output. You might need to return a boolean indicating whether the first player has a winning strategy or not."
