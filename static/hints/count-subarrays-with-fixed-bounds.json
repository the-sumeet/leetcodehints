      "content": "Start by understanding what a subarray is. A subarray is a contiguous section of an array. For example, in the array [1, 2, 3], the subarrays include [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2], [2, 3], and [3]."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the conditions for a fixed-bound subarray. It must have the minimum value equal to `minK` and the maximum value equal to `maxK`. This means you need to track both the minimum and maximum values as you explore subarrays."

      "content": "Consider how you can iterate through the array. You might want to use a sliding window or two-pointer technique to efficiently explore potential subarrays."

      "content": "Think about how to keep track of the positions of `minK` and `maxK`. You can maintain two pointers or indices that mark the last seen positions of these values."

    {
      "content": "As you traverse the array, when you encounter a value that is less than `minK` or greater than `maxK`, you should reset your tracking. This is because such values cannot be part of a valid fixed-bound subarray."

    {
      "content": "When you find both `minK` and `maxK` in the current subarray, count the number of valid subarrays that can be formed. This can be determined by the distance between the last seen positions of `minK` and `maxK`."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where all elements are the same as `minK` or `maxK`. For example, in an array like [1, 1, 1, 1] with `minK` and `maxK` both equal to 1, every subarray is valid."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can calculate the number of subarrays ending at the current index by determining how many valid starting points exist before it. This can be derived from the last occurrences of `minK` and `maxK`."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle scenarios where `minK` is greater than `maxK`. In such cases, there cannot be any valid subarrays, so you can return 0 immediately."
