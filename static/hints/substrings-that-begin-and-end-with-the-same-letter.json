    {
      "content": "Next, focus on the requirement: the substring must start and end with the same letter. For example, in 'abcba', the substrings 'a', 'b', 'c', 'abcba', 'bcb' satisfy this condition."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can iterate through the string to find all possible substrings. One approach is to use nested loops: the outer loop can represent the starting index and the inner loop can represent the ending index."

    {
      "content": "When you have a starting and ending index, check if the characters at these indices are the same. If they are, you have found a valid substring. You can keep a count of such valid substrings."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as strings with only one character. A single character string like 'a' should count as a valid substring since it starts and ends with 'a'."
