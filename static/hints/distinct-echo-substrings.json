      "content": "Start by understanding what it means for a substring to be an echo substring. An echo substring can be represented as `a + a`, where `a` is a non-empty string. This means that the substring must have an even length."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can identify substrings in the given text. A substring can be defined by its starting and ending indices. For a substring of length `2k`, the starting index can range from `0` to `n - 2k`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to check if a substring can be formed by concatenating a string with itself. For a substring `s[i:j]` to be an echo substring, it must satisfy the condition that `s[i:j]` is equal to `s[i:i+k] + s[i:i+k]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a loop to iterate through potential lengths of `a` (the base string) and check for each starting position if the substring is an echo substring. Remember to only consider lengths that are even."

      "content": "Consider using a set to store the distinct echo substrings. Sets automatically handle uniqueness, which is crucial since you need to count distinct substrings."

    {
      "content": "When generating substrings, ensure that you are checking for all possible starting indices and lengths. You might want to use a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through starting indices and the inner loop checks lengths."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints of the problem. The maximum length of the input string is 2000, which means that a naive solution that checks all substrings could be inefficient. Think about optimizing the substring checks."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can optimize the search for echo substrings by only checking even lengths. For example, if you find a substring of length `2`, you can then check for `4`, `6`, and so on, up to the maximum length."

    {
      "content": "To check if a substring is an echo substring, you can compare the first half of the substring with the second half. If they are equal, you have found an echo substring."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as strings that are too short to form any echo substrings. For example, a string of length `1` cannot have any echo substrings."

      "content": "Remember to account for overlapping substrings. For instance, in the string `abcabc`, the substrings `abcabc` and `bcabca` are distinct echo substrings despite sharing characters."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently store and retrieve substrings. You might want to use a hash set to store the substrings as you find them, which allows for O(1) average time complexity for insertions and lookups."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, keep track of the count of distinct echo substrings. You can simply return the size of the set at the end of your processing."

      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, test it with various inputs, including edge cases and longer strings. This will help ensure that your implementation is robust and handles all scenarios."
