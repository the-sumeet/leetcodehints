      "content": "Remember that a happy prefix must be non-empty and cannot be the entire string itself. This means you should consider prefixes of lengths from 1 to n-1, where n is the length of the string."

      "content": "Consider using a string matching algorithm like the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm. The KMP algorithm computes a 'prefix function' which can help identify the longest prefix that matches a suffix."
