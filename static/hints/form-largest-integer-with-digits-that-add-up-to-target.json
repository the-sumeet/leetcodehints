      "content": "Remember that the goal is to maximize the integer formed by the digits while ensuring that the total cost equals the target. This means you should focus on using the digits with the lowest cost to maximize the number of digits you can use."

      "content": "Think about the constraints: you need to ensure that the total cost of the digits used equals the target. If you can't reach the target cost with the available digits, you should return '0'."
