      "content": "Notice that for any integer i, the number of 1s in its binary representation can be related to the number of 1s in the binary representation of i // 2 (which is i right-shifted by 1). This relationship can help you build your answer iteratively."

      "content": "You can use the property that if you know the count of 1s for i // 2, you can determine the count for i. Specifically, if i is even, the count is the same as i // 2, and if i is odd, it is one more than the count of i // 2."
