      "content": "Consider using a sliding window approach. This technique allows you to expand and contract a window over the array to find valid subarrays without generating all possible subarrays explicitly."

      "content": "When you find a valid subarray (where the maximum appears at least k times), think about how to count all possible subarrays that can be formed from it.
