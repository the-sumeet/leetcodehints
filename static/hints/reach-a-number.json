      "content": "Start by understanding the movement pattern. Each move increases the number of steps taken: 1 step on the first move, 2 on the second, and so on. This means the total distance you can cover after `numMoves` is the sum of the first `numMoves` integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "The sum of the first `n` integers can be calculated using the formula: `S = n * (n + 1) / 2`. This sum represents the maximum distance you can reach after `n` moves if you only move in one direction."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the relationship between the target and the maximum distance you can reach. If the maximum distance after `numMoves` is less than the absolute value of the target, you need more moves. Think about how to check this condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you can move in both directions. If your total distance covered (`S`) is greater than or equal to the target, you need to check if the difference between `S` and the target is even. Why is this important?"
    },
    {
      "content": "The reason the difference must be even is that each move can be thought of as a 'step' that can either be positive or negative. If the difference is odd, you cannot reach the target because you would need to adjust the steps to balance out to the target."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the minimum number of moves, you could start with a loop that increments `numMoves` and calculates the sum `S` until you find a suitable `numMoves` that satisfies the conditions discussed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases: what happens if the target is very large or very small? How does this affect the number of moves required? Think about the implications of the constraints provided."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can also optimize your search for `numMoves` using a mathematical approach instead of brute force. For example, you can derive a relationship between `numMoves`, `target`, and the sum of the first `numMoves` integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, ensure you handle both positive and negative targets correctly. The logic should be symmetrical since the number line is infinite in both directions."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, write a function that returns the minimum `numMoves` based on the conditions we have discussed. Start with initializing `numMoves` and use a loop to check the conditions until you find the answer."
