      "content": "Consider the case where `s` and `goal` are already the same. In this scenario, swapping two identical characters (like 'a' in 'aa') will still yield the same string. Think about how you would handle this situation."

      "content": "When checking the two differing indices, ensure that the characters at these indices are such that swapping them would make the strings equal. This means you need to check if `s[i]` equals `goal[j]` and `s[j]` equals `goal[i]`."
