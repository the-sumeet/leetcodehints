    {
      "content": "Consider how the maximum integer you can choose affects your selection. If the maximum integer is less than the largest number in your array, you may need to adjust your selection strategy. What happens if the maximum integer is equal to or greater than the largest number in the array?"

    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints of the problem. Are there any limitations on how many integers you can choose? Are the integers in the array unique, or can there be duplicates? This will affect how you count your selections."

    {
      "content": "Visualize the selection process. If you have a maximum integer, how can you filter the integers in your array to only include those that are less than or equal to this maximum? You might want to sort the array first to simplify this process."

    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, consider how you will keep track of the integers you have chosen. Will you use a counter, or perhaps a list to store the selected integers? Think about how you will ensure that you do not exceed the maximum allowed count."

    {
      "content": "You may want to implement a method to check how many integers you can select without exceeding the maximum. This could involve a loop or a conditional check to ensure you are within the allowed range."

    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, think about how you will return the result. Are you returning the count of integers selected, or the integers themselves? Make sure your return format matches the requirements of the problem."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement a function that combines all the elements discussed. You will need to filter the array based on the maximum integer, count the valid selections, and return the correct output. Ensure you test your function with various inputs to cover edge cases."
