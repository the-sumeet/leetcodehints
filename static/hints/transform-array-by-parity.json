    {
      "content": "Consider how you can iterate through the array. You might want to use a loop or a list comprehension to apply the transformation to each element."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to check if a number is even or odd. You can use the modulo operator `%`. For example, `num % 2 == 0` checks if `num` is even."

      "content": "After transforming the array, you need to sort it. Familiarize yourself with sorting methods available in your programming language. In Python, for instance, you can use `sorted()` or the `.sort()` method."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that sorting will rearrange the elements. The final output should be in non-decreasing order, meaning all 0s should come before all 1s in the transformed array."

    {
      "content": "Think about the constraints given in the problem. The array length is between 1 and 100, and each integer is between 1 and 1000. This means your solution should handle small to moderately sized inputs efficiently."

      "content": "Make sure to test your solution with various inputs, including the minimum and maximum values for `nums`. This will help ensure your solution is robust."

      "content": "When implementing the transformation, consider using a single line of code to achieve both the mapping and sorting. This can make your solution more concise."
