      "content": "Start by understanding what 'nice divisors' are. A divisor is nice if it is divisible by every prime factor of n. For example, if n = 12 (with prime factors [2, 2, 3]), the nice divisors are those that can be formed from these factors."

      "content": "Consider how to construct the number n using the given prime factors. You have at most 'primeFactors' prime factors to work with, and you want to maximize the nice divisors."

    {
      "content": "Recall that the number of divisors of a number can be calculated if you know its prime factorization. If n = p1^e1 * p2^e2 * ... * pk^ek, the number of divisors is (e1 + 1)(e2 + 1)...(ek + 1)."

      "content": "Think about how to distribute the prime factors among different primes. The more evenly you distribute the prime factors, the more nice divisors you can create."

    {
      "content": "When distributing the prime factors, try to keep the exponent values as close to each other as possible. This is because the number of divisors grows when the exponents are balanced."

      "content": "You can use a greedy approach to maximize the number of nice divisors. Start with the smallest prime and try to assign as many factors as possible to it, then move to the next."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when primeFactors = 1. In this case, n would just be a prime number, and it would have exactly 1 nice divisor (itself)."

      "content": "Remember that the result should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7. This is important for handling large numbers, especially since primeFactors can be as large as 10^9."
