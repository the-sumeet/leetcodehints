      "content": "Consider how you can represent the current position in the array. You might want to use a loop to iterate through each element and decide whether to include it in your score or not."

      "content": "Think about how to keep track of the scores as you make your hops. You can use a variable to store the maximum score found so far, updating it as you explore different paths through the array."
