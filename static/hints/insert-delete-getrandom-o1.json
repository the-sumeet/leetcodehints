      "content": "You should use a combination of a list (or array) and a hash map (or dictionary). The list will help you store the elements for random access, while the hash map will allow you to quickly check for existence and get the index of elements."

      "content": "Ensure that your getRandom function can only be called when there is at least one element in the set. You might want to handle this with an assertion or a check at the beginning of the function."
