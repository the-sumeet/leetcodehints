    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the relationship between the prices and profits. Each price at index `i` corresponds to the profit at the same index. This means you will need to examine pairs of prices and their associated profits."

    {
      "content": "Think about the requirement for triplets. You need to find three indices `i`, `j`, and `k` such that `i < j < k`. This means you will be looking for combinations of indices that maintain this order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the prices must be strictly increasing. This means for any valid triplet `(i, j, k)`, the condition `prices[i] < prices[j] < prices[k]` must hold."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you identify valid triplets, calculate the total profit for each triplet as `profits[i] + profits[j] + profits[k]`. You will need to keep track of the maximum profit found."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when the length of the prices or profits list is less than 3. In these cases, you cannot form any triplets, so you should return 0 or an appropriate value."

      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find the triplets. A brute force method would involve checking all combinations of three indices, which could be inefficient for larger lists."

      "content": "You might want to explore using a nested loop approach where the outer loop fixes the first index and the inner loop finds valid pairs for the second and third indices."
    },

      "content": "When checking for valid triplet conditions, make sure to skip indices that do not satisfy the increasing price condition. Use a simple `if` statement to check this."
