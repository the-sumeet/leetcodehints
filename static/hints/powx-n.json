      "content": "Start by understanding the basic mathematical concept of exponentiation. Recall that raising a number to a power means multiplying that number by itself a certain number of times. For example, x^n means x multiplied by itself n times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle negative exponents. Remember that x^(-n) is equivalent to 1/(x^n). This means you'll need to handle the case when n is negative separately."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the edge cases for the input values. What happens if x is 0? What if n is 0? Make sure to define how your function should behave in these scenarios."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can optimize your solution using the concept of exponentiation by squaring. This technique reduces the number of multiplications needed, especially for large values of n. For example, x^n can be computed as (x^(n/2))^2 when n is even."

    {
      "content": "When implementing the function, consider using a loop or recursion to calculate the power. If using recursion, think about how you can break down the problem into smaller subproblems."

      "content": "Consider the data types you will use for your calculations. Since n can be very large, ensure that your implementation can handle large numbers without causing overflow."

      "content": "You might want to implement a base case for your recursion or loop. For example, if n equals 0, return 1, as any number raised to the power of 0 is 1."

      "content": "Think about how to implement the exponentiation by squaring method in your code. You can check if n is even or odd and adjust your calculations accordingly."
