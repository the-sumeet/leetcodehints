      "content": "Think about how you can represent a job. A job can be represented as a tuple or an object containing its start time, end time, and profit. This will help you manage the jobs more easily."

      "content": "Initialize your `dp` array. The profit from the first job can be set as `dp[0] = profit[0]`, since if you only have one job, the maximum profit is simply the profit of that job."

      "content": "For each job `i`, you need to decide whether to include it in your schedule or not. If you include it, you must find the last non-conflicting job that ends before `startTime[i]`."

      "content": "To efficiently find the last non-conflicting job, consider using binary search. This can help you quickly locate the job that ends the latest before the current job starts."

    {
      "content": "When calculating `dp[i]`, you have two options: either take the profit of the current job plus the profit of the last non-conflicting job, or skip the current job and take the profit from the previous job (`dp[i-1]`)."
    },
    {
      "content": "Your recurrence relation will look something like this: `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], profit[i] + dp[lastNonConflictingJob])`. Make sure to handle the case where there is no non-conflicting job."

      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when all jobs overlap or when there is only one job. In these cases, your algorithm should still return the correct maximum profit."
