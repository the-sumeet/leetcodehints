      "content": "Consider how to compute the product of a range of integers. You might want to use a loop or a mathematical approach to avoid overflow issues, especially since the product can grow very large."

    {
      "content": "Remember to count the trailing zeros in the product. Trailing zeros are created by factors of 10, which come from pairs of factors 2 and 5. You might want to count how many times each factor appears in the product range."
    },
    {
      "content": "To count trailing zeros efficiently, consider iterating through the range and counting the number of times you can divide by 5 (and 2) without a remainder. Focus on the limiting factor, which is usually the number of 5s."

      "content": "Once you have the product, remove the trailing zeros. You can do this by continuously dividing the number by 10 until it is no longer divisible by 10."

      "content": "When counting factors of 5 and 2, make sure to account for how many multiples of 5 and 2 are in your range. This will help you accurately calculate the number of trailing zeros."
