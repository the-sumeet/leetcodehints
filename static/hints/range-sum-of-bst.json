      "content": "Identify the base case for your traversal. If you reach a null node, you should stop your search. This is crucial for avoiding errors during tree traversal."

      "content": "Think about how to handle nodes that are outside the range. If a node's value is less than 'low', you can skip its left subtree entirely. If it's greater than 'high', skip the right subtree."

    {
      "content": "To get closer to the solution, outline a recursive function that takes a node and the range [low, high] as parameters. In this function, implement the logic to check the node's value and decide whether to traverse left, right, or add to the sum."
