      "content": "When adding a value to the odd indices, remember that digits wrap around after 9. For example, if you add 5 to 9, it becomes 4. Make sure to handle this wrap-around correctly in your implementation."

      "content": "Consider the effect of the rotation operation. Rotating the string changes the positions of the characters, which can lead to different configurations of the string. Think about how many unique rotations you can generate from the original string."

      "content": "Since the string has even length, the odd indices will always have a corresponding even index. Pay attention to how the addition operation affects pairs of characters in the string."

      "content": "You might want to explore all possible rotations of the string first. For each rotation, you can then apply the addition operation multiple times. This will help you find the minimum string configuration."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the string is already the smallest possible configuration or when the operations do not change the string significantly. How does the addition affect the digits, especially when they are near the maximum value?"
