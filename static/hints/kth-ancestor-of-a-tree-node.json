      "content": "You may want to optimize the ancestor retrieval process. Instead of traversing up one step at a time, consider using binary lifting, which allows you to jump multiple levels at once."

    {
      "content": "In binary lifting, you can create a 2D array where each entry `up[node][j]` represents the 2^j-th ancestor of `node`. This can significantly speed up the ancestor retrieval process."

    },
    {
      "content": "When filling the `up` array, remember that `up[node][0]` is simply `parent[node]`. For higher powers of two, you can use the relationship: `up[node][j] = up[up[node][j-1]][j-1]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "After preprocessing, the `getKthAncestor` method can use the `up` array to find the k-th ancestor in logarithmic time. You can decompose k into powers of two to find the ancestor efficiently."

    {
      "content": "As you process the bits of k, if you encounter a bit that is set (1), move to the corresponding ancestor in the `up` array. This allows you to skip multiple levels in one go."
