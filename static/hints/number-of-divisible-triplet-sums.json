      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find triplets in the array whose sum is divisible by a given number. Make sure you know what a triplet is: it's a combination of three elements from the array."

    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. What are the limits on the size of the input array and the value of the divisor? This will help you determine the efficiency of your approach."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can generate all possible triplets from the array. You can use three nested loops to iterate through the array indices, but this may not be efficient for larger arrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before diving into coding, consider how you can reduce the number of checks. For example, if the sum of three numbers is divisible by the divisor, what can you infer about the individual numbers?"
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking if the sum of a triplet is divisible by the given number, remember to use the modulo operator. For instance, if `sum = a + b + c`, check if `sum % divisor == 0`."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when the array has fewer than three elements. What should your function return in this case? Consider returning 0 or some indication that no triplets exist."

      "content": "If the input array has duplicate numbers, how will that affect your triplet counting? Make sure to handle duplicates correctly to avoid overcounting the same triplet."

    {
      "content": "Consider using a hash map or a set to store previously seen numbers. This can help you quickly check for the presence of required numbers to form a valid triplet."
    },
    {
      "content": "You may want to sort the array first to make it easier to find triplets. After sorting, you can use a two-pointer technique to find pairs that complement a third number."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will return the count of valid triplets. Will you return just the count, or do you need to return the triplets themselves? Make sure your return type matches the requirements."
