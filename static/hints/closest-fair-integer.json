      "content": "Consider how to generate fair integers. You can generate fair integers by repeating a single digit from 1 to 9 for the length of the input integer. For instance, for a 2-digit integer, you can generate 11, 22, 33, ..., 99."

      "content": "As you implement the comparison logic, remember to use the absolute value function to find the distance. For example: `distance = abs(fair_integer - input_integer)`."
