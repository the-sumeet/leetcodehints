      "content": "Start by understanding how to compute the intersection of two arrays. You can use a set to find distinct integers in each array and then find the common elements. This will help you implement the `intersect(a, b)` function."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the graph is undirected, meaning if there is an edge from node i to node j, there is also an edge from j to i. This property will be important when you are counting connected components."

    {
      "content": "When constructing the graph, ensure you only create edges between distinct nodes (i.e., i != j). This is crucial to avoid self-loops in your graph."

      "content": "Think about how you will represent the graph. An adjacency list or an adjacency matrix could be useful. Consider which representation will make it easier to traverse the graph."

    {
      "content": "To find the number of connected components, you can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Each time you start a new search from an unvisited node, you've found a new component."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where k is 1 or equal to m. These scenarios can lead to different numbers of edges in the graph, potentially affecting the number of connected components significantly."

      "content": "As you build the graph, keep track of which nodes have been visited to avoid counting the same component multiple times. This will help you accurately count the number of connected components."
