    {
      "content": "Consider how you will traverse the BST. A common approach is to use recursion or an iterative method. Think about how you can compare the target value with the current node's value to decide which direction to go next."

    {
      "content": "As you traverse the tree, keep track of the closest value you've found so far. You can initialize this with the root value or the first value you encounter. This will help you determine if a new value is closer to the target than the previous closest value."

      "content": "When you find a node, calculate the absolute difference between the node's value and the target value. If this difference is smaller than the difference for the current closest value, update your closest value."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when the tree has only one node. Make sure your function can handle this scenario without any errors."

      "content": "Consider the return type of your function. You need to return a single value, which is the closest value to the target. Ensure that your function's return statement is correctly set up."

      "content": "Remember that the problem specifies a unique closest value. If two values are equidistant from the target, you should return the smaller one. Keep this in mind as you update your closest value."

      "content": "You might want to implement a helper function to handle the recursive traversal of the tree. This function can take the current node and the target value as parameters."

      "content": "As you write your code, think about how you will handle the base case for your recursive function. You should return when you reach a null node, and also make sure to return the closest value found."

      "content": "Finally, ensure your function is efficient. The average time complexity for searching in a BST is O(log n), but in the worst case (a skewed tree), it could be O(n). Aim to keep your solution as efficient as possible."
