    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to find palindromic substrings of odd lengths. This means the length of the substring must be 1, 3, 5, etc. Consider how you can check for odd lengths when you find palindromes."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently check if a substring is a palindrome. A common method is to expand around the center of the substring. For a substring of odd length, you can use a single character as the center."

      "content": "You need to ensure that the two palindromic substrings do not overlap. This means that if you choose a substring from indices i to j, the next substring must start from index k where k > j."
