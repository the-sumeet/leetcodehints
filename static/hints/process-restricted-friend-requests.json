      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the problem. You have a network of people represented by integers from 0 to n-1, and you need to process friend requests while considering restrictions."

      "content": "Think about how you will represent friendships. You might want to use a union-find (disjoint-set) data structure to keep track of connected components, which can help in efficiently checking if two people can become friends."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle the restrictions. You need to ensure that if two people are restricted from becoming friends, they cannot be connected directly or indirectly through other friends."

      "content": "When processing each request, first check if the two people involved in the request are already friends. If they are, the request is automatically successful."

    {
      "content": "Next, if the two people are not friends, check if their connection would violate any restrictions. You will need to explore the connected components to see if adding this friendship creates an indirect connection between restricted pairs."

    {
      "content": "To check for indirect connections, you might want to maintain a mapping of each person to their connected component. This will help you quickly identify if adding a friendship would create a restricted link."

      "content": "As you process each request, think about how to efficiently update the friendships. If a request is successful, you should merge the two components in your union-find structure."
