      "content": "Consider how you can identify pairs of consecutive characters in the string. You might want to iterate through the string and check each character with its next neighbor."

      "content": "Think about how you will remove characters from the string. You can use string slicing or a list to make it easier to manipulate the characters as you perform removals."

    {
      "content": "When checking for consecutive characters, remember to check both orders. For example, if you find 'a' followed by 'b', thatâ€™s a valid pair, but also check if 'b' is followed by 'a'."

      "content": "Consider using a loop that continues until no more pairs can be found. You might need a flag to indicate whether any removals were made during an iteration."

      "content": "You may want to optimize your approach. Instead of repeatedly creating new strings, consider using a stack data structure to keep track of characters and easily manage removals."
