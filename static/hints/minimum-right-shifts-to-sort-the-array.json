      "content": "Consider how you can determine if the array is already sorted. You can check if each element is less than the next one, wrapping around to the first element after the last. This will help you identify if 0 shifts are needed."

      "content": "Think about the properties of a sorted array. If you can find a single point where the order breaks (i.e., an element is greater than the next), that might indicate where the array can be rotated to become sorted."
