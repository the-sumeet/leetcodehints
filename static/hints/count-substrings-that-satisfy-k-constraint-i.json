      "content": "While generating substrings, keep track of the counts of '0's and '1's in each substring. You can maintain two counters that increment as you extend the substring."

      "content": "Remember the k-constraint conditions: a substring is valid if it has at most k '0's or at most k '1's. Think about how you can check these conditions efficiently after generating each substring."

      "content": "Instead of checking the counts from scratch for each substring, consider using a sliding window approach. This allows you to adjust the counts incrementally as you expand or contract the window."

      "content": "When using a sliding window, maintain two pointers: one for the start of the substring and one for the end. As you move the end pointer to include more characters, update your counts accordingly."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when k is equal to the length of the string. In this case, all substrings will satisfy the k-constraint since the maximum count of '0's or '1's will never exceed k."
