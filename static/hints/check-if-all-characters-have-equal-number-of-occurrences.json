    {
      "content": "Consider using a data structure to store the frequency of each character. A dictionary or a hashmap can be useful here. As you iterate through the string, you can update the count of each character."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the case where the string has only one character. In such cases, the string is trivially good since there is only one character with one occurrence."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the frequency counts, think about how to check if all values in your frequency dictionary are the same. You might want to extract the counts into a list and check for uniqueness."

    {
      "content": "Consider using the `set` data structure to determine if all frequencies are the same. If you convert your list of counts into a set, it will only contain unique values. If the length of this set is 1, then all frequencies are the same."

      "content": "You might want to use a loop to iterate through the characters in the string and populate your frequency count. Pseudocode could look like this: `for char in s: count[char] += 1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "After counting the frequencies, you can check if all counts are equal. One way to do this is to convert the frequency values to a set and check if the length of the set is 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "Final step: Implement the logic to return `true` if all character frequencies are the same, and `false` otherwise. Make sure to test your function with various test cases to ensure correctness."
