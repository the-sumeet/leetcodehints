      "content": "Start by understanding the bug's jumping capabilities. The bug can jump forward by 'a' positions and backward by 'b' positions, but it cannot jump backward twice in a row. This means you need to alternate between forward and backward jumps."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the forbidden positions carefully. The bug cannot land on any of these positions, so you should keep track of them as you explore possible jumps. You could use a set for O(1) lookups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the bug's position and the number of jumps taken. A queue can be useful for performing a breadth-first search (BFS) to explore all possible positions the bug can reach."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using BFS, you can store the current position of the bug and the number of jumps taken to reach that position. This will help you find the minimum jumps needed to reach the home position 'x'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the bug can jump beyond its home position. Thus, you should not limit your search strictly to positions less than or equal to 'x'. Instead, consider a range that allows for overshooting."
    },
    {
      "content": "You need to ensure that the bug does not jump to negative positions. This means you should only consider positions that are non-negative (>= 0) during your BFS exploration."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the stopping condition for your BFS. You should stop when you reach position 'x' and return the number of jumps taken. If you exhaust all possibilities without reaching 'x', return -1."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing the BFS, you can keep track of the last jump direction (forward or backward) to ensure that you don't jump backward twice in a row. Use a flag or a state variable for this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when 'x' is 0 (the starting position) or when 'a' and 'b' are very large compared to the forbidden positions. These cases might allow for a quick solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the BFS using a queue. For each position, enqueue the next possible positions based on the jump rules, and make sure to check against the forbidden positions and the last jump direction."
