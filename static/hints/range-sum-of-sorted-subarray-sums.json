      "content": "Start by understanding how to compute the sum of all non-empty continuous subarrays from the given array. For an array `nums`, a subarray can be defined by its starting and ending indices. Think about how you can iterate through the array to generate these sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the number of continuous subarrays for an array of length `n` is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. This means you will have a lot of subarray sums to handle, so consider how you can efficiently store them."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the sums of all subarrays, the next step is to sort these sums in non-decreasing order. Sorting can be done using built-in functions, but think about the time complexity and whether you need to optimize this step."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the indexing in the problem statement. The indices for `left` and `right` are 1-based, while most programming languages use 0-based indexing. Make sure to adjust your indices accordingly when accessing the sorted array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will handle the modulo operation. Since the result can be a large number, you will need to apply the modulo `10^9 + 7` to your final sum. This is a common practice in competitive programming."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `left` and `right` are the same. What happens if you only need to sum one element? Ensure your logic accounts for this scenario."
    },
    {
      "content": "When generating the subarray sums, you might want to use a nested loop structure. The outer loop can iterate over the start index of the subarray, while the inner loop can compute the sum for each subarray starting from that index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you compute the subarray sums, consider storing them in a list or an array. After generating all sums, you can sort this collection. Be mindful of the potential size of this array."
    },
    {
      "content": "After sorting the sums, you need to extract the portion of the array from index `left` to `right`. This can be done using slicing or a loop, but remember to apply the 1-based to 0-based index conversion."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your implementation correctly returns the sum of the specified range, applying the modulo operation as needed. You are very close to the solution now!"
