    {
      "content": "Consider how many points are available for each segment. If you choose a segment that starts at point i and ends at point j, you cannot choose points i through j for another segment. This introduces the concept of non-overlapping segments."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to represent the segments. You can represent a segment from point i to point j as a tuple (i, j). Make sure to account for the fact that segments can share endpoints."

      "content": "When calculating the number of ways to form k segments, consider using dynamic programming. Define a state that represents the number of ways to form segments up to a certain point with a certain number of segments."

      "content": "Consider the base case for your dynamic programming solution. For example, if k = 0, there is exactly one way to select 0 segments, regardless of n. Think about how to build from this base case."

      "content": "Finally, structure your dynamic programming table carefully. You might want to use a 2D array where dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to form j segments using the first i points. Think about how to fill this table based on your earlier insights."
