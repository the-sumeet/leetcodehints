    {
      "content": "Start by understanding how division works with parentheses. For example, in the expression 'a/(b/c)', the division of 'b/c' is computed first, which affects the overall value significantly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the order of operations. Division is not associative, meaning '(a/b)/c' is not necessarily equal to 'a/(b/c)'. This means the placement of parentheses can drastically change the result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to maximize the value of the expression. Generally, you want to keep larger numbers in the numerator and minimize the impact of smaller numbers in the denominator."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that for an array with more than two elements, the best strategy often involves placing parentheses around the last elements. For example, in 'a/(b/c/d)', try to evaluate 'b/c/d' together."
    },
    {
      "content": "Check the edge cases. If the array has only two elements, the expression is simply 'a/b'. But for three or more elements, you should consider how to group the last elements."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you have more than two numbers, the optimal division often looks like 'a/(b/c/d)'. This suggests that you should focus on the last two or three elements for your parentheses."
    },
    {
      "content": "To avoid redundant parentheses, ensure that you only group elements that change the order of operations. For instance, in 'a/(b/c)', adding extra parentheses around 'b' or 'c' is unnecessary."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to construct the final expression as a string. You need to format it correctly, ensuring that the final output does not include unnecessary parentheses."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the constraints. The input will always have at least two elements, and each element is guaranteed to be between 2 and 1000. This simplifies some edge case handling."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, remember that there is only one optimal division for the given input. Focus on finding that unique arrangement of parentheses that maximizes the expression value."
