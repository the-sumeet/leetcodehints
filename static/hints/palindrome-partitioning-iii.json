      "content": "Consider how to split the string into `k` parts. Each part must be a palindrome. Think about how the splits can affect the number of changes needed."

      "content": "For any substring, calculate how many changes are required to make it a palindrome. This can be done by comparing characters from the start and end moving towards the center."

    {
      "content": "To find the number of changes needed for a substring `s[l:r]`, iterate from `l` to `r` and count mismatches: `changes += (s[l] != s[r])`. This gives you the number of changes for that specific substring."

    {
      "content": "You might want to precompute the number of changes needed for every possible substring of `s`. Store these in a 2D array `changes[i][j]` where `changes[i][j]` represents the number of changes needed to make `s[i:j]` a palindrome."

      "content": "The base case for your DP could be when `j = 1`, meaning you only need to make the entire substring `s[0:i]` a palindrome. This is simply `changes[0][i-1]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "For `j > 1`, you need to consider all possible positions to make the last cut. For each position `p`, the cost would be `dp[p][j-1] + changes[p][i-1]`."

    {
      "content": "After filling the DP table, the answer will be found in `dp[n][k]`, where `n` is the length of the string. This will give you the minimum changes needed for `k` palindromic partitions."
