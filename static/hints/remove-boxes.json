      "content": "Start by understanding the problem. You need to remove boxes of the same color in contiguous groups and gain points based on the size of the group you remove. The points you earn for removing k boxes is k * k."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can remove boxes in different orders. The order in which you remove boxes can affect the total points you can achieve. Think about the implications of removing a group of boxes before or after another group."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about using recursion or dynamic programming. You can break the problem down into smaller subproblems by removing boxes and calculating points for the remaining boxes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the base case for your recursive function. When there are no boxes left, the score is 0. This will help you build your recursive solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "When removing boxes, you can also consider how many boxes of the same color are adjacent to the boxes you are removing. This can help you maximize your score by potentially forming larger groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to keep track of how many boxes of each color are present. This will help you decide which boxes to remove and when."
    },
    {
      "content": "Use memoization to store results of subproblems. Since the same configuration of boxes can be encountered multiple times, storing results can save computation time."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the two-pointer technique for efficiently finding groups of boxes. This can help you identify contiguous boxes of the same color quickly."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating points, remember to add the points from removing the current group to the points obtained from the remaining boxes. This combination is key to maximizing your score."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when all boxes are of the same color or when there are no boxes left to remove. How would your solution handle these cases?"
    },
    {
      "content": "You can also explore how removing boxes affects the remaining boxes. For example, if you remove a box, it may create new groups or merge existing groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to visualize the problem with examples. Drawing out the boxes and the points you can earn with different removal strategies can provide insights."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a recursive function that takes the current state of the boxes, the starting index, and the ending index as parameters. This will allow you to explore different removal strategies."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to account for the points gained from removing boxes that may create new opportunities for removal in subsequent steps. This is crucial for maximizing your score."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to implement the recursive function with memoization. You will need to define a way to uniquely identify the state of the boxes for caching results."
