      "content": "Consider the implications of the requirement that `nums[i + 1]` must be greater than `nums[i]`. This means that the array must be strictly increasing, which will influence how you choose your elements."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can start constructing the array. The first element can be set to `x`, but you need to ensure that subsequent elements maintain the required AND result while also being greater than the previous element."

    {
      "content": "Explore the idea of using the properties of binary numbers. If you want the AND of all elements to equal `x`, each element must have at least the bits set that are in `x`."

      "content": "Consider the case where `n = 1`. In this scenario, the only element in the array must be `x`. Think about how this affects your approach for larger `n`."

    {
      "content": "For larger values of `n`, you will need to find a way to generate numbers that are greater than `x` while still ensuring that the AND of all selected numbers equals `x`. This might involve incrementing from `x`."

    {
      "content": "When constructing the array, think about how to choose the subsequent elements. You might want to ensure that each new element has the same bits as `x` in certain positions, while also having additional bits set to ensure the increasing condition."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that the last element of the array, `nums[n - 1]`, should be minimized. This means you should try to find the smallest possible values for the elements while satisfying the AND condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you find that constructing the array directly is complex, consider working backwards. Start with a potential value for `nums[n - 1]` and see if you can construct valid previous elements that satisfy the conditions."

    {
      "content": "Finally, remember to check edge cases, such as when `x` is very small compared to `n`. This could lead to situations where the numbers must be very close together, affecting your choices."
