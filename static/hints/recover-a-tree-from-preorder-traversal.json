      "content": "Identify how to parse the input string. You can split the string into segments by recognizing the number of dashes preceding each number. The number of dashes tells you the depth of the corresponding node."

      "content": "When you encounter a new node, check if its depth is greater than the last node's depth. If it is, that means it is a child of the last node. If it's less, you'll need to backtrack up the tree to find the correct parent."

      "content": "As you parse through the string, maintain a stack to help with backtracking. The stack can hold nodes as you go deeper into the tree, allowing you to easily find the parent when you need to backtrack."
