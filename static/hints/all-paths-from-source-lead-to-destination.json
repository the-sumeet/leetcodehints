      "content": "Start by understanding the graph representation of the problem. The input edges define a directed graph where each node can lead to one or more other nodes. Visualizing the graph can help you see the paths clearly."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you will traverse the graph. Depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) are common techniques for exploring paths in a graph. Think about how you can implement one of these methods to explore all paths from the source to the destination."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the graph can have cycles. You need to ensure that you don't revisit nodes in a way that could lead to infinite loops. Keep track of visited nodes during your traversal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the destination node. If you reach the destination, you need to check if there are any other outgoing edges from it. If there are, it means the path does not lead to a valid destination."

      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where the source node is the same as the destination node. This is a special case that needs to be addressed in your logic."

      "content": "When checking for paths, ensure that you are only counting paths that lead to the destination without any further edges. You might want to implement a condition that verifies this during your traversal."

    {
      "content": "As you build your solution, think about how you will return the result. You need to return a boolean indicating whether all paths from the source lead to the destination. Ensure your return logic is clear."

      "content": "Finally, test your solution with various test cases, including edge cases like self-loops, disconnected nodes, and multiple paths. This will help ensure your solution is robust."

    "The graph is directed, meaning edges have a direction from one node to another.",
