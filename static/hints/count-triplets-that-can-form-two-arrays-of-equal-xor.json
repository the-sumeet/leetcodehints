    {
      "content": "To solve this problem, first understand the properties of the XOR operation. XOR is both associative and commutative, which means the order of operations does not matter. This can help you when calculating the cumulative XOR for ranges."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the two segments defined by indices `i`, `j`, and `k`. The first segment is from `i` to `j-1` and the second segment is from `j` to `k`. Think about how you can calculate the XOR for these segments efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a prefix XOR array to help compute the XOR of any subarray in constant time. The prefix XOR at index `p` can be defined as `prefix[p] = arr[0] ^ arr[1] ^ ... ^ arr[p]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "With the prefix XOR array, you can compute the XOR for the first segment as `a = prefix[j-1] ^ prefix[i-1]` (taking care of boundaries) and for the second segment as `b = prefix[k] ^ prefix[j-1]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Now, think about how you can iterate through possible values of `j` and for each `j`, determine valid pairs of `(i, k)` such that the XORs `a` and `b` are equal. This will help you reduce the search space."
    },
    {
      "content": "For each fixed `j`, you can maintain a count of how many times each XOR value has appeared for the first segment (from `i` to `j-1`). Use a hash map to keep track of these counts."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you calculate the XOR for the second segment `b` while iterating through `k`, check how many times the corresponding value of `a` has been seen in your hash map. This will give you the number of valid `(i, j, k)` triplets for that particular `j`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the array has only one or two elements. In such cases, there won't be enough indices to form a triplet, so you should return 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the indices must satisfy `0 <= i < j <= k < arr.length`. Pay attention to the boundaries when iterating through the indices to avoid out-of-bounds errors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your solution efficiently counts the triplets without using a brute-force approach, which would be too slow for larger arrays. Aim for a time complexity better than O(n^3) by leveraging the prefix XOR and hash map."
