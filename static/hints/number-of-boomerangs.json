      "content": "Remember that the distance between two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) can be calculated using the formula: distance = (x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)². This avoids floating-point inaccuracies."

      "content": "Since the points are distinct, you won't have to worry about the same point being counted multiple times. However, you should consider the order of points when counting boomerangs."
