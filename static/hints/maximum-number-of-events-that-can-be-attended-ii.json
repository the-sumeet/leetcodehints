      "content": "Consider how you can represent the events in a way that allows you to sort them. Sorting by endDay can be beneficial because it helps in determining which events can be attended sequentially."

      "content": "Think about how you can keep track of the maximum values you can achieve by attending events. A good approach is to use dynamic programming to store the maximum values up to a certain number of events attended."

      "content": "When considering which events to attend, think about the conflicts. If two events overlap, you can't attend both. You may need to skip one for a potentially higher value event."
