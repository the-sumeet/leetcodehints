      "content": "Start by understanding what powers of three are. The first few powers of three are: 3^0 = 1, 3^1 = 3, 3^2 = 9, 3^3 = 27, etc. You need to find combinations of these that add up to the given number n."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the number n in terms of powers of three. You can think of it as a binary representation where each bit can either include or exclude a specific power of three."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can generate the powers of three up to the maximum possible value of n (10^7). You can use a loop to calculate these powers until you exceed n."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since you need distinct powers of three, make sure you do not use the same power more than once. This is similar to the subset sum problem where you want to find a subset that sums to a target."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a recursive approach or backtracking to explore all combinations of the powers of three. Keep track of the current sum and the index of the power you are considering."

    {
      "content": "Alternatively, consider using a greedy approach. Start from the largest power of three that is less than or equal to n and subtract it from n, then continue with the next largest power."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, remember to handle edge cases. For example, if n is 1, the answer should be true since 1 = 3^0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Another approach is to use a while loop to continuously divide n by 3. If at any point n is not divisible by 3 and is not equal to 1, then it cannot be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of three."

    {
      "content": "Think about the properties of numbers in base 3. If you convert n to base 3, check if any digit is greater than 1. If it is, then you cannot represent n as a sum of distinct powers of three."

      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to check the base 3 representation of n. If all digits are either 0 or 1, return true; otherwise, return false."
