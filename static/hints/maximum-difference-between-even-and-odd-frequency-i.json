      "content": "When iterating through the frequency counts, check if the frequency is odd or even. Use the modulus operator to determine this: `freq % 2 == 1` for odd and `freq % 2 == 0` for even."

      "content": "As you find odd frequencies, update your maximum odd frequency variable if the current frequency is greater. Similarly, update your minimum even frequency variable when you find an even frequency."

      "content": "Before returning the result, ensure that your difference calculation makes sense. You want to return the maximum difference found, so double-check your logic."
