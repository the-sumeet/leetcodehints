      "content": "Consider how you can represent the blooming of flowers over time. You might want to think about using a timeline or an array to keep track of which flowers bloom on which days."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the slots are only valid if they are empty. You need to check the conditions carefully to ensure that you have 'k' empty slots between two blooming flowers."

      "content": "Pay attention to the edge cases. What if 'k' is larger than the number of flowers? Or what if flowers bloom on the same day?"

      "content": "Think about how to handle the case where there are multiple flowers blooming on the same day. How will this affect your counting of empty slots?"

      "content": "Consider using a data structure that allows you to efficiently track the positions of flowers as they bloom. A list or a set might be useful here."

    {
      "content": "You might want to keep a count of the number of empty slots you have seen so far. This will help you compare against 'k' when a new flower blooms."

    },
    {
      "content": "Think about corner cases, such as when the input array is empty or has only one flower. What should your function return in these scenarios?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the output format correctly. You need to return the day as an integer. What if no valid configuration is found?"
