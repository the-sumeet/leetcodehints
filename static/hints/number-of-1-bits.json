    {
      "content": "Once you have the binary representation, think about how to count the '1's in that string. You can iterate through the string or use a built-in method to count occurrences of '1'."

      "content": "Remember that the problem states that n is always a positive integer. This means you won't have to handle negative numbers or zero."

      "content": "Think about the efficiency of your solution. If this function is called many times, using a straightforward string conversion could become a bottleneck. Can you think of a way to count bits without converting to a string?"

      "content": "One efficient way to count set bits is using bit manipulation. You can repeatedly check the least significant bit (LSB) of the number and then right-shift the number. This way, you can count bits without converting to binary."

      "content": "You can also use a technique called Brian Kernighan's Algorithm, which repeatedly clears the lowest set bit and counts how many times you can do this until the number becomes zero."

      "content": "Consider the maximum value for n, which is 2^31 - 1. This means your solution should handle large integers efficiently without running into performance issues."

    {
      "content": "If you decide to use bit manipulation, remember that you can use the bitwise AND operation to check if the least significant bit is set. For example, `n & 1` will tell you if the last bit is '1'."

      "content": "To finalize your approach, think about how you would implement the counting logic in a loop or a recursive function. Make sure to return the count of set bits as the final output."
