      "content": "Consider how the properties of the matrix can help you. Since each row is sorted, if you find a 1 in a row, all columns to the right will also be 1s."

      "content": "Think about the goal: you need to find the leftmost column that contains at least one '1'. This implies you should be looking for the smallest column index that meets this condition."

      "content": "You might want to iterate through the matrix to find the 1s, but consider whether there are more efficient ways to traverse the matrix given its sorted nature."

    {
      "content": "A common approach is to start from the top-right corner of the matrix. If you find a 1, you can move left; if you find a 0, you can move down. This can help you narrow down your search efficiently."

      "content": "If you reach the end of your traversal without finding a 1, you should return a specific value to indicate that there is no column with at least one 1."

      "content": "Remember to account for the case where all columns have at least one 1. In such cases, your leftmost index should be updated accordingly."
