      "content": "Remember that you need to check three conditions for each triplet. Specifically, these conditions involve the absolute differences between the elements at indices i, j, and k. Make sure you can express these conditions clearly."

      "content": "When implementing the nested loops, ensure that the outer loop runs from 0 to arr.length - 3, the middle loop from i+1 to arr.length - 2, and the innermost loop from j+1 to arr.length - 1. This will help maintain the condition i < j < k."
