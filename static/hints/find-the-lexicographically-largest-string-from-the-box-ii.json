      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find the lexicographically largest string by performing at most 'k' swaps of adjacent characters. Remember that 'lexicographically largest' means it should come last in dictionary order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the input string and the number of swaps allowed. For example, in 'dbca' with 2 swaps, think about how you can rearrange the characters to achieve the largest possible string."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify the constraints of the problem. You can only swap adjacent characters and you are limited to 'k' swaps. This means that the order of characters is important, and you cannot just rearrange them freely."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can use a greedy approach to tackle this problem. You might want to always try to bring the largest possible character to the front of the string as much as you can with the given swaps."
    },
    {
      "content": "When considering which characters to swap, keep track of how many swaps you have left. This will help you decide whether to make a swap or to hold off for a more beneficial swap later."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can start by iterating through the string and for each character, look ahead to see if there's a larger character within the range defined by your remaining swaps. This will help you identify potential swaps."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you find a larger character within the range, calculate how many swaps it would take to bring that character to the current position. If it's less than or equal to your remaining swaps, perform the swap."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the string is already sorted in descending order or when 'k' is larger than the length of the string. How should your algorithm handle these cases?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that after a swap, you need to decrement your swap counter. This will ensure you do not exceed the allowed number of swaps."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently keep track of the characters you have already considered for swapping. You might want to use a data structure that allows you to quickly access the largest character within the allowed range."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you perform swaps, keep updating the string and checking if you can still make further swaps. Itâ€™s important to continuously assess the state of your string after each operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you've used up your swaps or reached the end of the string, you should return the modified string. Make sure to handle the return format correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a loop that runs through the string while checking for the largest possible character to swap with, and keep track of your swaps in a systematic way."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your approach, write down a few test cases, including edge cases, and manually trace through your logic to ensure it holds up."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to implement your logic in code. You might want to use a nested loop where the outer loop iterates through the string and the inner loop checks for possible swaps."
