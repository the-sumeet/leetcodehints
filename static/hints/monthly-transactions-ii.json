      "content": "Focus on the 'Transactions' data first. Identify which fields are important for your final output. You will likely need the 'id', 'amount', and 'trans_date' fields for each transaction."

    {
      "content": "Next, consider how to handle the 'Chargebacks'. Each chargeback is linked to a transaction by 'trans_id'. You need to determine which transactions have been charged back and how that affects your calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to filter the transactions. You want to include only those transactions that were approved and not charged back. This means you'll need to check both the 'state' of each transaction and whether its 'id' exists in the 'Chargebacks' list."

      "content": "As you filter the transactions, keep track of the total amount of approved transactions. You can initialize a variable to accumulate this total as you iterate through the transactions."

    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to filter, sum, and prepare your final output. You should have a clear plan for iterating through the transactions and checking against the chargebacks. For example: \n\n```\nfor transaction in transactions:\n    if transaction.id not in chargebacks_set:\n        total_amount += transaction.amount\n```\n\nEnsure you handle all necessary conditions."
