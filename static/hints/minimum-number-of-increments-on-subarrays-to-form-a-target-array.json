    {
      "content": "Consider how you can determine the number of operations needed to reach each element in the `target` array. What happens when you move from one element to the next? Do you need to perform an operation, or can you carry over increments from previous operations?"

    {
      "content": "Think about the differences between consecutive elements in the `target` array. For example, if you have `target[i]` and `target[i-1]`, how does the difference affect the number of operations? This could help you minimize operations."

      "content": "Instead of thinking about the entire array at once, break it down. Focus on how many increments are needed for each position based on its previous value. This will help you build a clearer picture of the total operations needed."

      "content": "You might want to keep track of the total operations as you iterate through the `target` array. Consider using a variable to accumulate the number of operations required as you process each element."
