    {
      "content": "Consider how many bottles you can drink in one go. Each time you drink a bottle, you increase your count of empty bottles. Keep track of both full and empty bottles as you perform operations."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you have enough empty bottles to exchange for a full one, you can perform the exchange. Remember that after each exchange, `numExchange` increases by one. This means the number of empty bottles required for the next exchange will change."

    {
      "content": "You need to implement a loop that continues as long as you have full bottles or enough empty bottles to exchange for at least one full bottle. Think about how to structure this loop effectively."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you drink from the full bottles, you should also update your count of empty bottles. Be careful to ensure that you are correctly tracking both the full and empty bottles after each operation."

    {
      "content": "After exchanging empty bottles for a full one, you should increment `numExchange` by one. This is a critical part of the problem, as it directly affects how many bottles you can exchange in subsequent rounds."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where you might not have enough empty bottles to perform an exchange. You should ensure that your loop can handle these situations gracefully."

      "content": "You might want to use a variable to keep track of the total number of bottles drunk. This will help you return the final count at the end of your calculations."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the logic, remember to check how many full bottles you can get from the empty ones after each exchange. This will help you maximize the total number of bottles consumed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to exit your loop. You should stop when you can no longer drink full bottles or exchange enough empty bottles for at least one full bottle. What condition will you use to check this?"
