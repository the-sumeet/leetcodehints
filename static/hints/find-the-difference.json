      "content": "Start by thinking about how you can compare the two strings. Since string t is derived from string s by adding one letter, you need a way to identify the extra character."

      "content": "Consider the lengths of the strings. Since t is always one character longer than s, you can use this property to your advantage when comparing the two strings."

    {
      "content": "One approach is to use a frequency count of the characters in both strings. You can create a count for each character in string s and then decrement the count using characters from string t."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that string t will contain all characters from string s plus one additional character. This means that after processing both strings, you should be left with one character that has a count of 1."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when s is an empty string. In this case, the extra character in t should be the only character present."

    {
      "content": "You could also consider using a data structure like a dictionary or a list to keep track of character counts. This will help you easily identify the character that appears an odd number of times."

    {
      "content": "Alternatively, you might explore using the XOR operation. If you XOR all characters in both strings, the result will be the extra character because identical characters will cancel each other out."

      "content": "If you choose to use sorting, remember that sorting both strings and comparing them character by character can also help you find the extra character, but it may not be the most efficient approach."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the return type correctly. You need to return the extra character as a string, so ensure that your final output format matches this requirement."

      "content": "As a final step, implement your chosen approach and test it against the provided examples. Pay attention to edge cases, such as when s is empty or contains repeated characters."
