    {
      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the absolute difference between two elements. The formula `abs(nums[i] - nums[j])` will be crucial. Make sure you understand how to implement this in your code."
    },
    {
      "content": "To ensure that the indices are at least `x` apart, think about the range of indices you can use for `j` when you are at an index `i`. For example, if `i` is 0, then `j` must start from `i + x`."

    {
      "content": "You might want to keep track of the minimum absolute difference you find as you iterate through the array. Initialize a variable to store this minimum difference and update it whenever you find a smaller difference."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a nested loop approach where the outer loop iterates through each element and the inner loop checks elements that are at least `x` indices away. This will help you ensure the index constraint is satisfied."

      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `x` is 0. In this case, you can compare every pair of elements in the array. How would this change your approach?"

      "content": "As you implement the nested loops, remember that the time complexity can grow quickly with larger arrays. Try to optimize your approach if you notice performance issues with larger inputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can also consider using data structures like a sorted list to help efficiently find the minimum difference as you iterate through the array. This could reduce the number of comparisons needed."

      "content": "When you find a minimum difference, make sure to check if it is actually the smallest one found so far. You might want to use a comparison operator to update your minimum difference variable."

      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct type of value. You need to return an integer representing the minimum absolute difference. Make sure to test your implementation with the provided examples to confirm correctness."
