      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to find a subarray (a contiguous part of the array) whose sum is at least equal to the target value. Think about how you can calculate the sum of subarrays efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a sliding window technique. This approach allows you to maintain a window of elements that you can expand or contract to find the minimal length subarray that meets the sum condition."
    },
    {
      "content": "Initialize two pointers (let's call them `start` and `end`) to represent the current subarray. As you move the `end` pointer to include more elements, keep track of the current sum of the subarray."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once the sum of the current window is greater than or equal to the target, you should try to shrink the window from the left (move the `start` pointer) to find the minimal length. Keep track of the minimum length found."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where no such subarray exists. If after processing all elements you haven't found a valid subarray, you should return 0."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: `1 <= target <= 10^9`, `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`, and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`. This will guide your choice of algorithm and data structures."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the array has only one element or when all elements are less than the target. How will your algorithm handle these scenarios?"

      "content": "As you implement your solution, make sure to test it with the provided examples and some additional edge cases to ensure it behaves as expected."
    },
    {
      "content": "For the follow-up question, think about how you could use sorting or binary search to achieve a time complexity of O(n log(n)). This might involve pre-computing prefix sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "You are very close to the solution! Try to implement the sliding window approach now, ensuring you keep track of both the current sum and the minimum length of valid subarrays found."
