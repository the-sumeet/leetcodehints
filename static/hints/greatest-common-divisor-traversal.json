      "content": "Consider how you can represent the problem. A graph can be a useful representation where each index in the array is a node, and an edge exists between two nodes if their GCD is greater than 1."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently compute the GCD for pairs of numbers in the array. The built-in GCD function in many programming languages can help, but consider the time complexity when dealing with large arrays."
