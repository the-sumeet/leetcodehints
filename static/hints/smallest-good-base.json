      "content": "Start by understanding what a 'good base' means. A base `k` is good for `n` if when you represent `n` in that base, all digits are `1`. For example, in base `3`, `13` is represented as `111`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the mathematical representation of `n` in base `k`. If `n` is represented as `111...1` in base `k`, it can be expressed as `k^m + k^(m-1) + ... + k^1 + k^0`, which simplifies to `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1) = n`."
    },
    {
      "content": "From the equation above, you can derive that `n * (k - 1) = k^(m+1) - 1`. This means you can find potential values of `k` by manipulating this equation."

    {
      "content": "Note that `k` must be at least `2`. This means the smallest good base for any `n` must be `2` or higher."

    {
      "content": "The maximum possible value for `m` (the number of digits in the base representation) can be derived from the logarithmic relationship. Specifically, `m` can be at most `log2(n)`, as each digit in base `k` contributes exponentially."
    },
    {
      "content": "To find the smallest good base, consider iterating over possible values of `m` starting from `log2(n)` down to `1`. This will help you find the largest `k` first, which is what you're looking for."
    },
    {
      "content": "For each `m`, calculate `k` using the formula derived earlier. Rearranging gives you `k = (n - 1)^(1/(m+1))`. This will give you a starting point for potential bases."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating `k`, ensure to check if it is an integer. If not, you may need to adjust your calculations slightly to find the nearest integer base."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to validate if the calculated `k` indeed satisfies the condition of being a good base by checking if `n` equals `(k^(m+1) - 1) / (k - 1)`."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `n` is a power of `2`. In these cases, the smallest good base will be `2`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through potential values of `m`, keep track of the smallest valid `k` found. This will be your answer."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you reach `m = 1`, the corresponding base `k` will always be `n - 1`, which is valid but not necessarily the smallest good base."

    {
      "content": "Ensure your implementation handles large values of `n` efficiently, as the constraints allow `n` to be as large as `10^18`."
