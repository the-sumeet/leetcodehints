    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the vertical position of each node. You might want to use a coordinate system where the root node is at position 0, left children decrease the position by 1, and right children increase it by 1."

    {
      "content": "As you traverse the tree, you will need to keep track of both the node values and their corresponding vertical positions. A good data structure to use for this is a map or dictionary."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to traverse the tree. A breadth-first search (BFS) approach using a queue can be effective here, as it allows you to process nodes level by level."
    },
    {
      "content": "When processing each node, remember to also record its vertical position. You might want to use a tuple or a small object that contains both the node's value and its vertical index."

    {
      "content": "As you compile the final output, remember that the result should be a list of lists, where each inner list contains the values of nodes at that vertical level. Ensure that you format your output correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how you will handle tie-breaking when nodes share the same vertical position. The problem states that nodes should be ordered from top to bottom, so you need to ensure your implementation respects this."

    "The tree is represented as a list where 'null' indicates the absence of a node.",
    "The output should be a list of lists, with each inner list representing nodes at the same vertical level.",
    "Vertical indices are determined based on the position of nodes relative to the root, starting from 0.",
    "If two nodes are in the same vertical position, they should be ordered by their depth in the tree."
