      "content": "Since the order of the sides matters in the triangle inequality, consider sorting the array first. This will help you easily check the conditions for forming a triangle."

    {
      "content": "After sorting the array in non-decreasing order, remember that if you take the three largest sides, they are the most likely candidates for forming a valid triangle. Why? Because larger sides can potentially create a larger perimeter."

      "content": "When checking for the triangle condition, focus on the last three elements of the sorted array. If nums[n-1], nums[n-2], and nums[n-3] are the three largest sides, check if nums[n-2] + nums[n-3] > nums[n-1]."
