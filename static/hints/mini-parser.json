      "content": "Think about how to parse the string. You can iterate through the characters of the string and maintain a stack to handle nested lists. This is especially useful for keeping track of the current context as you encounter brackets."

    {
      "content": "When you encounter a '[', it indicates the start of a new NestedInteger list. You should create a new NestedInteger object and push it onto the stack. When you encounter a ']', pop the top object from the stack and add it to the last NestedInteger on the stack."
    },
    {
      "content": "Handle the integers carefully. When you encounter a digit or a negative sign, you need to extract the entire number until you hit a delimiter like ',', '[', or ']'. Make sure to convert it to an integer before adding it to your NestedInteger."

      "content": "Pay attention to commas. They separate elements in the list. You should only create a new NestedInteger for an integer or a nested list when you encounter a comma after processing a complete number or list."

      "content": "Make sure to test your parser with various inputs, including deeply nested lists and single integers. This will help you ensure that your logic is robust and can handle the maximum constraints."

      "content": "You are close to the solution! Implement the logic to read from the stack and construct the NestedInteger objects as you parse through the string. Remember to handle the transitions between integers and lists carefully."
