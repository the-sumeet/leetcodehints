      "content": "Consider the relationship between `startValue` and `target`. If `startValue` is greater than or equal to `target`, the only operation needed is to decrement until you reach `target`. How many decrements would that take?"
    },
    {
      "content": "If `startValue` is less than `target`, you need to think about how to efficiently reach `target` using the available operations. Multiplying by 2 can quickly increase the value, but you may also need to subtract to fine-tune your result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to work backwards from `target` to `startValue`. This can sometimes simplify the problem: if `target` is even, consider what would happen if you divided it by 2 instead of multiplying. If it's odd, you would have to add 1 to make it even before halving."

      "content": "When working backwards, keep track of how many operations you would need to perform. For example, if you divide by 2, that counts as one operation, and you can continue from there."

      "content": "Remember to handle both the multiplication and subtraction operations carefully. You may need to decide dynamically which operation to apply based on the current value relative to `target`."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, think about the efficiency of your approach. Can you reduce the number of operations needed by choosing the right operation at each step?"
