      "content": "Start by understanding how XOR works. Recall that XOR of two bits is 1 if they are different and 0 if they are the same. This property will be crucial in determining the value of k that maximizes the result."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that you need to maximize the expression `nums[0] XOR nums[1] XOR ... XOR nums[n-1] XOR k`. This means the value of k should be chosen based on the XOR of all elements in nums at each step."

      "content": "You can compute the cumulative XOR of the entire array `nums` first. This will help you quickly adjust the result as you remove elements from the end of the array."

    {
      "content": "Remember that k must be less than `2^maximumBit`. This means k can take on values from 0 to `2^maximumBit - 1`. Make sure to keep this range in mind when selecting k."

      "content": "As you process each query, you will be removing the last element of nums. Think about how this affects the cumulative XOR value. You will need to update this value accordingly."

      "content": "Consider how to find the optimal k for each query. Since you want to maximize the XOR, you should try to find a k that, when XORed with the current cumulative XOR, yields the maximum possible value."

      "content": "To maximize the XOR result, consider the binary representation of the cumulative XOR. The highest possible value you can achieve with k is `2^maximumBit - 1`. Think about how this value interacts with the cumulative XOR."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating k, you can use the formula: `k = (2^maximumBit - 1) XOR cumulativeXOR`. This will give you the value of k that maximizes the overall XOR given the current state of nums."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when nums has only one element left. In this case, k should still be chosen from the valid range to maximize the XOR with that single element."
