      "content": "When you double, you can significantly increase your current integer, but you can only do this a limited number of times. Think about how to balance between using increments and doubles to minimize the total moves."

      "content": "Keep track of the current number and the number of moves taken. You can use a loop to simulate the process, but ensure you respect the limit on doubles."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to structure your loop. You might want to continue doubling while it's beneficial, and switch to increments when you can't double anymore or when you're close to the target."
