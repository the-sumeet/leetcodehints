      "content": "Start by understanding how to calculate the XOR of three numbers. Recall that XOR has properties such as: a ⊕ a = 0 and a ⊕ 0 = a. This means that if you have three numbers, you can compute their XOR easily."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the XOR result will have a certain number of set bits (1s). You need to find triplets where the XOR of the three numbers results in an even number of set bits."
    },
    {
      "content": "To count the number of set bits in a number, you can use a simple method: repeatedly check if the least significant bit is set (using bitwise AND with 1) and then right shift the number until it becomes 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to iterate through all possible triplets in the given list. You can use three nested loops to generate all combinations of triplets, but consider the size of the input list to avoid performance issues."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking the XOR of a triplet, you can store the result in a variable and then pass it to a function that counts the number of set bits. This modular approach can help keep your code organized."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when the input list has fewer than three elements. What should your function return in such cases? Think about how you can handle these scenarios gracefully."

      "content": "Make sure to keep track of the count of valid triplets that meet the condition of having an even number of set bits. You can initialize a counter variable at the start of your function."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the count of valid triplets, think about how you will return this value. Ensure your function returns the count as an integer, as specified in the problem statement."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement the solution, consider testing it with various input cases, including edge cases such as all elements being the same or all being zero. This will help ensure your solution is robust."

    {
      "content": "Finally, optimize your solution if necessary. If the brute-force approach is too slow for larger inputs, think about how you might reduce the number of checks or leverage properties of XOR to improve efficiency."
