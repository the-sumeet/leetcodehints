      "content": "Start by understanding how to split the string into two halves. Since the string length is guaranteed to be even, you can simply find the midpoint and use slicing to get both halves. For example, if `s` is 'book', `a` would be `s[:2]` and `b` would be `s[2:]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Next, identify the vowels that you need to count. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' in both uppercase and lowercase. You might want to create a set of these characters for quick lookup."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to count the vowels in each half. You can iterate through each character in both halves and check if it is in your set of vowels. Keep a count for both halves."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle both uppercase and lowercase letters. A good approach is to convert each character to lowercase before checking if it is a vowel."
    },
    {
      "content": "After counting the vowels in both halves, you need to compare the two counts. If they are equal, the two halves are alike; otherwise, they are not."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. For example, what if the string has no vowels at all? In this case, both halves would have a vowel count of zero, and your function should return true."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, ensure that you handle the string length constraint properly. The minimum length is 2, so you don't need to check for empty strings or odd lengths."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to use a loop or a comprehension to count the vowels efficiently. For example, you could use a generator expression to sum the counts directly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the return type of your function. You need to return a boolean value: `true` if the halves are alike and `false` otherwise. Make sure your final comparison is correct."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, put all the pieces together. After splitting the string and counting the vowels, your final step is a simple comparison of the two counts. If they match, return true; otherwise, return false."
