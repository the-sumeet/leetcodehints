      "content": "Notice that the length of the palindrome, `intLength`, affects how you generate them. For odd lengths, the middle digit can vary, while for even lengths, the first half determines the second half."

      "content": "Consider the range of numbers that can form palindromes of a specific length. For example, for `intLength = 3`, the smallest palindrome is 101 and the largest is 999."

      "content": "Think about how to generate palindromes efficiently. You can construct them by taking the first half of the number and mirroring it. For example, for the first half '12' in a 3-digit palindrome, the full palindrome would be '121'."

      "content": "Remember that leading zeros are not allowed. This means that the first digit of the first half must be non-zero. For instance, if you are generating a 4-digit palindrome, the first half should start from 10 (for 1001) and not from 00."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind the number of palindromes that can be generated with a given length. For `intLength`, the total number of palindromes is determined by the range of valid first halves. For example, for 3 digits, the first half can range from 10 to 99."

      "content": "Consider using a loop to generate palindromes based on the first half of the number. For each valid first half, create the full palindrome by mirroring it. For example, if `firstHalf = 12`, then `palindrome = 121`."
