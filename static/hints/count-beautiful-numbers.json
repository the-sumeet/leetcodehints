      "content": "Start by understanding the definitions: a number is beautiful if the product of its digits is divisible by the sum of its digits. This means you need to calculate both the product and the sum for each number in the range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to extract the digits of a number. You can do this by repeatedly taking the modulus and integer division by 10. For example, for a number `n`, you can get the last digit using `n % 10`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the digits, think about how to compute the sum and product. Initialize two variables, one for the sum and one for the product, and update them as you iterate through the digits."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the case when the product is zero. If any digit is zero, the product will be zero, and you should check if the sum is also zero to avoid division by zero."
    },
    {
      "content": "You will need to iterate through all the numbers from `l` to `r`. Consider using a loop to go through each number in this range and apply your digit extraction logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to count the beautiful numbers. You can maintain a counter that increments each time you find a beautiful number within the specified range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints. The range can be very large (up to 10^9), so ensure your solution is efficient enough to handle this without timing out."
    },
    {
      "content": "To optimize, consider that you might not need to check every single number if you can identify patterns. For example, numbers with certain digit combinations may frequently yield beautiful results."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to test your implementation with edge cases, such as when `l` and `r` are the same, or when they are at the extremes of their allowed values."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you will return the result. The problem states to return the count of beautiful numbers, so ensure your final output is just that count."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to write helper functions to keep your code organized. For instance, a function to check if a number is beautiful could help simplify your main logic."
    },
    {
      "content": "When checking if a number is beautiful, remember to check the divisibility condition carefully. Use the modulo operator to verify if the product is divisible by the sum."
    },
    {
      "content": "Debugging can be crucial. Print intermediate values like the sum and product for a few numbers to ensure your logic is working as expected."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases with single-digit numbers. All single-digit numbers (1-9) are beautiful since their product equals their sum."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you approach a solution, think about how you can streamline your checks. For instance, if the sum is 0, you can immediately skip to the next number."
