      "content": "Start by understanding the two operations you can perform: incrementing values and doubling all elements. Think about how these operations can be combined to reach the target array from the initial array of zeros."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the maximum value in the target array `nums`. This value will dictate how many operations you may need to perform. How can you break down the operations required to reach this maximum value?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the binary representation of the numbers in `nums`. Each bit represents a power of two, which could help you understand how many doubling operations you might need."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you double the values, you effectively increase all values in the array exponentially. This means that you might want to perform doubling operations strategically to minimize the number of increments needed afterward."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to visualize the process. For example, if you need to reach a number like 5, you might first double to get to 4, then increment to 5. What is the sequence of operations that would minimize the total number of calls?"

      "content": "Consider how many times you can double before you need to increment. If you have a number like 10, how many times can you double it from 0 before you reach or exceed it?"

    {
      "content": "Think about working backwards from each number in `nums`. If you start at a number and reduce it by half (if it's even), or subtract one (if it's odd), how many steps does it take to reach zero?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that for each number in `nums`, you can track how many increments and doublings are needed separately. This can help you optimize the total number of function calls."
    },
    {
      "content": "When implementing your solution, consider using a loop to process each number in `nums` and calculate the required operations. Keep a running total of the operations needed."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure you account for edge cases, such as when all numbers in `nums` are the same or when they are all zeros. How does this affect your operation count?"
