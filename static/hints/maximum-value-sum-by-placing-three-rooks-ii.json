      "content": "Start by understanding the constraints of placing rooks on the board. Remember that rooks in the same row or column cannot attack each other. This means that each rook must occupy a unique row and a unique column."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can represent the positions of the rooks. You can think of using a nested loop to iterate through possible positions for the first rook, and then filter out invalid positions for the subsequent rooks."

    {
      "content": "To maximize the sum, you should keep track of the maximum values you can obtain as you place each rook. Think about how you can store the current maximum sums as you iterate through the board."

    {
      "content": "When you place the first rook, calculate its value and then mark its row and column as unavailable for the next rooks. This will help you avoid placing rooks that can attack each other."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to explore all combinations of placing three rooks. You can use a combination of nested loops or recursion to try different placements of the rooks on the board."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the board has negative values. You might need to ensure that you are still maximizing the sum even when some values are negative."

      "content": "Think about how you can optimize your approach. For instance, if you can precompute the maximum values for each row and column, it may reduce the number of calculations needed when placing the rooks."

      "content": "As you explore different placements, keep a variable to track the maximum sum encountered so far. Update this variable whenever you find a new valid placement of three rooks."

    {
      "content": "Remember to reset your state after placing each rook so that the next combination starts fresh. This is crucial for ensuring you do not carry over invalid states."

      "content": "Consider using a backtracking approach. When you place a rook, you can recursively attempt to place the next rook, and if you reach a valid configuration, calculate the sum."

      "content": "When calculating the maximum sum, ensure that you are only considering valid rook placements. This means checking that the rows and columns are unique for each rook."

    {
      "content": "You might want to create a helper function to check if a rook placement is valid based on the already placed rooks. This can simplify your main logic."

    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your solution. Since you are dealing with a 2D array, nested loops can lead to high complexity, so consider ways to reduce this."

    {
      "content": "When iterating over potential rook placements, remember that the order in which you place them can affect the maximum sum. Explore different orders to find the best configuration."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your function returns the correct format as specified in the problem statement. You need to return the maximum sum of the cell values for the rooks placed."
