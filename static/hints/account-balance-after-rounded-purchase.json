      "content": "When rounding, remember that numbers ending in 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 round down, while numbers ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 round up. This is crucial for correctly implementing the rounding logic."

      "content": "To round the purchase amount, you might want to use the formula: roundedAmount = round(purchaseAmount / 10) * 10. This will give you the nearest multiple of 10."
