      "content": "Start by understanding what a substring is. A substring is any contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For example, in the string 'abc', the substrings include 'a', 'ab', 'abc', 'b', 'bc', and 'c'."

      "content": "Consider how you might generate all possible substrings of a given string. You can use nested loops: the outer loop can fix the starting index, while the inner loop can vary the ending index. This will help you get all substrings."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you generate substrings, think about how to store them. You will want to ensure that you only keep distinct substrings. Using a data structure that automatically handles uniqueness, like a set, can be very helpful."
    },
    {
      "content": "When adding substrings to your set, remember to take care of the indices properly. For a string of length n, the starting index can range from 0 to n-1, and the ending index can range from the starting index to n."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with all identical characters. What should your function return in these cases? Think about how these cases affect the count of distinct substrings."

      "content": "To improve efficiency, you might want to explore more advanced data structures or algorithms. For instance, suffix arrays or tries can help you find distinct substrings more efficiently than the naive approach."

      "content": "If you choose to implement a suffix array, remember that it provides a way to store all suffixes of a string in sorted order. This can help you identify distinct substrings by examining overlaps."

      "content": "You can also consider using a rolling hash to efficiently check for distinct substrings. This technique allows you to compute hash values for substrings and compare them quickly."
