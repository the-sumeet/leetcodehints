      "content": "Remember that the multiplication should be done modulo (10^9 + 7). This is important to prevent overflow and to meet the problem's constraints."

    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the indexing in the queries. The indices `l_i` and `r_i` are inclusive, and you should ensure that your loop does not exceed these bounds."

    {
      "content": "You might want to test your function with edge cases, such as when all elements in `nums` are the same or when `v_i` is 1, which should leave the array unchanged."
