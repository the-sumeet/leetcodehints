The first operation inverts characters from the start of the string up to index `i`, while the second operation inverts characters from index `i` to the end. Think about how these operations affect the string."

      "content": "Consider what it means to make all characters equal. You can either convert all characters to '0' or all to '1'. This will help you determine the target character you want to achieve."

      "content": "Take a look at the costs associated with each operation. The cost of the first operation is `i + 1` and the cost of the second operation is `n - i`. How do these costs compare as `i` changes?"

      "content": "When calculating the cost, remember to account for the state of the string after each operation. If you invert a segment, you change the characters in that segment, which affects subsequent operations."
