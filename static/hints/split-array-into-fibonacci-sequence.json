      "content": "Consider how to split the input string into potential numbers. You will need to iterate through the string and create pairs of numbers to check if they can form a Fibonacci-like sequence."

      "content": "Remember to check for leading zeros. A number cannot have leading zeros unless it is '0' itself. For example, '01' is invalid, but '0' is valid."

      "content": "Think about the constraints on the numbers. Each number must be a non-negative integer and should fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer (0 to 2^31 - 1). This will limit the size of the numbers you can form from the string."

      "content": "As you build the sequence, keep track of the numbers you have found. If at any point the sum of the last two numbers does not equal the next segment, you should break out of the loop and try a new pair."
