      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to cover the entire garden from point 0 to point n using the taps, which have specific ranges. Each tap can cover a certain interval based on its index and range."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how each tap's range translates into the actual intervals it can cover. For example, a tap at index `i` with a range of `ranges[i]` can cover from `max(0, i - ranges[i])` to `min(n, i + ranges[i])`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the intervals covered by each tap. You might want to create a list of tuples where each tuple represents the start and end of the coverage for each tap."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the case where a tap's range does not extend to the left of 0 or beyond the right end of the garden at n. This will help you avoid invalid intervals."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the intervals, sort them by their starting point. This will help you efficiently find the minimum number of taps needed to cover the garden."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a greedy approach. Start from the leftmost point of the garden (0) and try to extend your coverage as far as possible with the available taps."
    },
    {
      "content": "While iterating through the sorted intervals, keep track of the farthest point you can reach with the taps you have opened so far. This will help you decide when to open a new tap."
    },
    {
      "content": "If at any point you find that you cannot extend your coverage (i.e., the next tap starts after your current coverage), you should return -1 immediately."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you open a new tap, make sure to count it towards your total. Each time you extend your coverage, check if you've covered the entire garden."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to check edge cases, such as when all taps have a range of 0 or when the garden length n is very small."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider how to handle cases where multiple taps can cover the same area. You should always choose the tap that extends your coverage the farthest."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the time complexity of your approach. Sorting the intervals will take O(n log n), but ensure that your greedy selection process is linear, O(n), to maintain efficiency."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to return the minimum number of taps opened. If you managed to cover the garden, return that number; otherwise, return -1 if it's impossible."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, test it with various edge cases, such as when all taps are at the ends or have overlapping ranges that can be confusing."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement your greedy algorithm carefully, ensuring you correctly update your current position and the number of taps opened as you iterate through the intervals."
