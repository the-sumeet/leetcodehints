    {
      "content": "Consider how you can use the tires repeatedly. Each tire can be used for multiple laps, and the time taken for each successive lap increases exponentially based on the `r[i]` value. How will this affect your choice of tires?"

      "content": "Think about the impact of the `changeTime`. If you switch tires, you incur a cost of `changeTime` seconds. This means you need to weigh the benefits of changing tires against the time you save by using a tire for multiple laps."

    {
      "content": "To minimize the total time, you might want to calculate how many laps you can complete with a single tire before switching becomes beneficial. Try to determine a threshold where the time saved by switching tires outweighs the `changeTime`."

      "content": "Consider precomputing the time taken for each tire for a certain number of laps. For example, compute the time for the first few laps (up to a reasonable limit) for each tire type and store these values."

      "content": "Remember to account for the case where you might want to change tires after completing a certain number of laps. This means you will need to iterate over possible lap counts to find the optimal switching point."

      "content": "When calculating the total time for a combination of laps and tire changes, ensure you are correctly adding the `changeTime` only when a tire switch occurs. Be careful with your indexing!"

      "content": "Edge cases can include scenarios where `numLaps` is very small (like 1 or 2) or very large. Make sure your solution handles these cases efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you find that the time for a tire becomes too large (e.g., exceeding a certain threshold), consider stopping the calculation for that tire. This can save computation time."
