    {
      "content": "Remember that the indices of the array `nums` are 0-based. This means the first element is at index 0, the second at index 1, and so on. Ensure your logic accounts for this indexing correctly."
    },
    {
      "content": "You will need to iterate through the indices of the `nums` array. For each index, calculate the number of set bits and check if it equals `k`. Consider using a helper function to encapsulate the logic for counting set bits."

    {
      "content": "When counting set bits, consider using the built-in function `bin(x).count('1')` in Python, which gives you the number of 1s in the binary representation of `x`. This can simplify your implementation."

      "content": "As you iterate through the indices, maintain a running total of the elements in `nums` that meet the criteria of having exactly `k` set bits. Think about how to initialize and update this sum."

      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when `k` is 0. In this case, only the index 0 (which is 0 in binary) has 0 set bits. Make sure your code handles this scenario correctly."

    {
      "content": "Also, think about the maximum value of `k`, which is 10. This means you will only be checking indices up to 1023 (since 2^10 - 1 = 1023) for their binary representation. Ensure your loop does not exceed the length of the `nums` array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the sum should only include elements from `nums` where the corresponding index has exactly `k` set bits. Be careful to only add these elements to your total sum."

      "content": "You might want to write test cases that cover various values of `k`, including edge cases like `k = 0` and `k` being larger than the number of bits in the maximum index."
