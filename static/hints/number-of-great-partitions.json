      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to partition the array into two groups where the sum of each group is at least `k`. Consider how you can check the sums of these groups."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the total sum of the array. If the total sum is less than `2 * k`, it's impossible to create two groups that satisfy the condition. This can help you quickly eliminate some cases."

    {
      "content": "Consider the properties of partitions. Each element can either go into Group 1 or Group 2. This binary decision for each element suggests a combinatorial approach."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the order of groups matters in this problem. For example, ([1, 2], [3]) is different from ([3], [1, 2]). Keep this in mind when counting partitions."

      "content": "You can use a bitmask to represent the inclusion of each element in either group. This will help you systematically explore all possible partitions."

      "content": "When generating partitions, ensure you calculate the sums of both groups correctly. You might want to maintain two separate sums as you iterate through your bitmask."

      "content": "Make sure to handle large numbers properly. Since the result can be very large, remember to take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step to avoid overflow."
