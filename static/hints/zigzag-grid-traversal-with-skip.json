      "content": "Remember that you need to skip every alternate cell during your traversal. This means that if you are at cell (i, j), you will visit it only if (j % 2 == 0) for rightward traversal and (j % 2 == 1) for leftward traversal."

      "content": "When you reach the end of a row while moving right, you will need to move down to the next row. Make sure to account for the direction change when you switch rows. For example, if you are moving left in the next row, you will start from the last column."
