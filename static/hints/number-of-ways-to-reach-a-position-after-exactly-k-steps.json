      "content": "Calculate the distance you need to cover: `distance = endPos - startPos`. This distance will help you understand how many steps you need to take in one direction versus the other."

      "content": "Next, note that to reach `endPos` in exactly `k` steps, the parity (even or odd nature) of `distance` and `k` must match. If one is even and the other is odd, it's impossible to reach the target."

    {
      "content": "If you can reach the target, think about how you can represent your movements. You can denote moving right as +1 and moving left as -1. How can you express your total movements in terms of right and left steps?"

      "content": "Define `r` as the number of right steps and `l` as the number of left steps. You know that `r + l = k` and that `r - l = distance`. Can you derive a formula to express `r` and `l` in terms of `k` and `distance`?"

      "content": "From the equations `r + l = k` and `r - l = distance`, derive the values of `r` and `l`. You should find that `r = (k + distance) / 2` and `l = (k - distance) / 2`. What conditions must hold for `r` and `l` to be valid?"

    {
      "content": "Ensure that both `r` and `l` are non-negative integers. This means that `k + distance` and `k - distance` must both be even and non-negative. How can you check these conditions?"

      "content": "The number of ways to choose `r` steps from `k` total steps can be calculated using the binomial coefficient: `C(k, r)`. Remember to compute this modulo `10^9 + 7` as specified in the problem."
