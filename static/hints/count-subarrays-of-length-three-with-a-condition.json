      "content": "Consider the condition given in the problem: the sum of the first and third elements should equal half of the second element. This can be expressed mathematically as `nums[i] + nums[i+2] = nums[i+1] / 2`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle the indices correctly. Since you are looking for subarrays of length 3, your loop should iterate from the start of the array to the third last element. This means your loop should run until `len(nums) - 2`."

      "content": "Think about how you can count the valid subarrays. You can initialize a counter variable to zero and increment it each time you find a valid subarray that meets the condition."
