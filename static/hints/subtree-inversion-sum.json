      "content": "Familiarize yourself with the concept of subtree inversion. When you invert a node, all values in its subtree are multiplied by -1. Consider how this affects the sum of the tree's values."

      "content": "Identify the importance of the distance constraint on inversions. If you invert a node, you cannot invert its ancestor or descendant nodes unless they are at least 'k' edges apart."

      "content": "Think about how to represent the tree in code. A common approach is to use an adjacency list. For example, if you have edges like [[0,1], [0,2]], you can create a list where node 0 points to nodes 1 and 2."
