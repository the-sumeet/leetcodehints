      "content": "Start by understanding what factorization means. For a given number, you want to express it as a product of smaller integers. For example, the number 48 can be factored into 6 and 8, or 4 and 12."

    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. You need to find the minimum number that can be formed by multiplying the factors of the given number. This means you should focus on using the smallest digits possible."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the range of digits you can use. Since the problem involves forming a number from its factors, the digits must be between 1 and 9. This limits your options for factorization."
    },
    {
      "content": "When factoring the number, start from the largest digit (9) and go down to 2. This way, you can ensure that you are using the largest possible factors first, which helps in minimizing the resultant number."
    },
    {
      "content": "Keep track of the factors you find. You can store them in a list or an array. For example, if you find that 48 can be divided by 6, you can add 6 to your list of factors."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to combine the factors to form the minimum possible number. After collecting all valid factors, think about how to arrange them to get the smallest numerical value."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases where the number is prime or too small. For instance, if the input is 1, you should return 1 since it cannot be factored further."
    },
    {
      "content": "Be mindful of the return format. You need to return the minimum factorization as a number, not as a list of digits. Ensure you convert your list of digits back into a single integer."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle cases where no valid factorization can be found. For example, if the number is 11, which is prime, the output should be 0 or some indication that factorization is not possible."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the logic to combine the factors into the smallest possible number. You might want to sort the list of digits before combining them to ensure they are in the correct order."
