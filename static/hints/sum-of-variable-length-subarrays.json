    {
      "content": "For each index `i`, you need to determine the starting point of the subarray. This is defined as `start = max(0, i - nums[i])`. Make sure you understand how to calculate this value."

    {
      "content": "Once you have the `start` index for each `i`, you can calculate the sum of the elements in the subarray `nums[start ... i]`. Consider how you would iterate through the array to achieve this."

      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently calculate the sum of the subarray for each index. You might want to use a cumulative sum or a running total to avoid recalculating sums repeatedly."

    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the case when `nums[i]` is greater than `i`. In this scenario, the `start` index will be 0, meaning the subarray will include all elements from the beginning of the array up to `i`."

      "content": "When implementing your solution, ensure that you are correctly indexing into the array. Remember that array indices start at 0 in most programming languages."

    {
      "content": "Finally, put together your logic into a function. You will loop through each index `i`, calculate the subarray sum, and accumulate these sums to get your final result. Think about how you would structure this loop."
