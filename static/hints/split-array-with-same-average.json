      "content": "Consider the definition of the average. The average of an array is the sum of its elements divided by the number of elements. This means that for two arrays A and B to have the same average, the ratio of their sums to their lengths must be equal."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of having non-empty arrays A and B. Since both arrays must be non-empty, this means you cannot simply take all elements from nums and put them in one array."
    },
    {
      "content": "Notice that if the total sum of nums is S and the total number of elements is N, then the average of the entire array is S/N. For A and B to have the same average, their combined sums must relate to their sizes in a specific way."
    },
    {
      "content": "Since the average is a ratio, consider how you can express the condition of equal averages mathematically. If A has k elements and B has N-k elements, you can set up an equation based on their sums."

    {
      "content": "Remember that the problem allows you to split nums into any two non-empty subsets, which means you can explore combinations of elements. Think about how you might represent these combinations programmatically."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to consider using a recursive approach or backtracking to explore all possible ways to split the array into two subsets. Keep track of the sums and sizes of both subsets as you do this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints: the array length can be at most 30. This suggests that a combinatorial approach might be feasible, but you need to be careful about performance."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you could use dynamic programming or memoization to store results of previously computed subsets. This could help avoid recalculating the same sums multiple times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the case where the sum of nums is zero. What does that imply about the possible splits? This could lead to a quick conclusion in some scenarios."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that the elements of nums can be repeated. This could lead to multiple valid splits. How will you ensure you handle duplicates correctly?"

    {
      "content": "If you find a valid split, remember to return true immediately. You don't need to find all possible splits, just one that satisfies the condition."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when nums has only two elements. What are the implications for splitting in this case, and can you quickly determine the outcome?"

      "content": "As you build your solution, think about how to efficiently check if a certain sum can be achieved with a given number of elements. This could involve combinations or subset sums."
