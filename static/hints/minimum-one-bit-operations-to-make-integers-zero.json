      "content": "Start by understanding the binary representation of the integer `n`. Each bit in the binary number can be either 0 or 1. For example, the binary representation of 3 is `11`."
    },
    {
      "content": "The operations you can perform are based on the bits of `n`. The first operation allows you to change the rightmost bit, which means you can always clear the least significant bit if it's 1."

      "content": "Consider how many bits are set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`. Each 1 bit will require at least one operation to clear it."
    },
    {
      "content": "When you change the i-th bit, it can only be done if the (i-1)th bit is 1 and all lower bits (0 to i-2) are 0. This means you need to carefully plan your operations."

      "content": "Think about how you can represent the number of operations needed to clear each bit. You might want to use a counter to track the operations as you process each bit."

    {
      "content": "If you encounter a 1 bit, check its position. If it's the least significant bit, you can clear it directly. If it's higher, you'll need to ensure the bits below it are already cleared."

      "content": "Consider the order of operations. It might be beneficial to clear bits from the least significant to the most significant to avoid complications with the higher bits."
