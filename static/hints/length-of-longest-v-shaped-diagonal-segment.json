      "content": "Focus on the four possible diagonal directions: top-left to bottom-right, bottom-right to top-left, top-right to bottom-left, and bottom-left to top-right. You will need to check for segments in each of these directions."

      "content": "When you find a '1', consider how to extend the segment diagonally. You can check the next element in the diagonal direction to see if it matches the expected sequence (2, 0, 2, 0, ...)."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the grid is very small (like 1x1 or 1xN). Make sure your logic handles these cases correctly, as they might not have enough elements to form a V-shape."
