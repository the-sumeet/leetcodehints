      "content": "Start by understanding the problem. You need to find the minimum time required to break all locks, where each lock has a specific time associated with it. Think about how you can represent the locks and their respective times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how the locks can be broken. Is there a specific order that needs to be followed, or can they be broken simultaneously? This will help you determine if you need to account for overlapping times."
    },
    {
      "content": "Look at the input format. You will receive an array of integers representing the time each lock takes to break. Make sure to handle the case where the array might be empty."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases. What happens if all locks have the same time? How would you approach this scenario differently compared to when they have varying times?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a priority queue (min-heap) to keep track of the locks. This data structure can help you efficiently get the lock with the minimum break time."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you process each lock, think about how you can keep track of the total time taken. You might need to maintain a counter or a variable to accumulate the time."
    },
    {
      "content": "Explore the possibility of breaking multiple locks at once. If you can break locks in parallel, how does that affect the total time? You may need to consider the maximum time among the locks being broken simultaneously."
    },
    {
      "content": "When calculating the minimum time, be mindful of how you handle ties. If two locks take the same amount of time, how will you decide which one to break first?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can optimize your approach. Are there any unnecessary calculations you can avoid? For instance, breaking locks in a specific order might not be needed if you can handle them all together."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. Are there limits on the number of locks or the maximum time for each lock? Understanding these constraints can help you tailor your solution."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a greedy approach. By always breaking the lock that takes the least time, you can potentially minimize the overall time taken."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, make sure to test it against various test cases, especially edge cases like single lock scenarios or locks with maximum time values."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the return format of your solution. Are you returning the total time as an integer, or is there a specific format required? Ensure your output matches the expected format."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, review your logic for any potential off-by-one errors, especially if you're using zero-based indexing for the array of locks."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, consider how you will handle large inputs. If the number of locks is very high, will your solution still be efficient? Aim for a solution that scales well."
