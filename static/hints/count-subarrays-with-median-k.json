      "content": "Consider how to identify subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous segment of the original array. You can use two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays, but think about how to optimize this."

      "content": "When checking if a subarray has a median of k, you'll need to sort the subarray first. However, sorting each subarray can be inefficient. Think about how you could avoid sorting by keeping track of the counts of elements relative to k."

      "content": "To find the median, you need to know how many elements are less than and greater than k in the subarray. This will help you determine if k is the median based on the size of the subarray."

      "content": "If you have a subarray of size m, the median will be k if the number of elements less than k is equal to m // 2 (for odd m) or (m // 2) - 1 (for even m). This is crucial for checking the median condition."

      "content": "When counting valid subarrays, ensure you are not counting empty subarrays. Your count should only include non-empty subarrays that satisfy the median condition."

      "content": "As you implement your solution, test it with small arrays first to validate your logic. For example, try arrays of size 1, 2, and 3 to see how the median behaves."

      "content": "After generating subarrays, you can optimize your checks by using a sliding window approach. This way, you can incrementally build your subarrays instead of starting from scratch each time."

      "content": "Finally, think about the overall time complexity of your approach. Given the constraints (up to 100,000 elements), ensure your solution runs efficiently, ideally in O(n log n) or O(n) time."
