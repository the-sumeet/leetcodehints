      "content": "Consider how the frog moves. It starts at vertex 1 and can jump to any directly connected unvisited vertex. Think about how you can represent the graph using an adjacency list."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the frog cannot jump back to a visited vertex. This means you need to keep track of which vertices have been visited during its jumps."
    },
    {
      "content": "The frog's jumps are probabilistic. If it has multiple options, it jumps to one of them with equal probability. Make sure to calculate the probability based on the number of unvisited neighbors."

    {
      "content": "Think about the base case: If the frog has no unvisited neighbors, it remains on the current vertex. This should affect your probability calculations."

    {
      "content": "Consider using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the tree. This will help you simulate the frog's jumps over time."

    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when 't' is 0. If 't' is 0, the frog is still at vertex 1, so the probability of being at any other vertex is 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "If the target vertex is the starting vertex (1), the probability should be 1 if 't' is 0, or it should be calculated based on the frog's movements otherwise."

    {
      "content": "Consider memoization to store previously computed probabilities for specific states (current vertex, time left) to avoid redundant calculations."

    {
      "content": "You may want to represent the graph as a dictionary of lists or a similar structure for efficient traversal. For example: `graph = {1: [2, 3, 7], 2: [1, 4, 6], ...}`."

      "content": "Finally, consider how to implement the recursive function to calculate the probability. You will need parameters for the current vertex, time left, and a set of visited vertices."
