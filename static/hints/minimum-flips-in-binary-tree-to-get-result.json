      "content": "Focus on the leaf nodes of the tree first. They represent the base cases of your boolean expressions. If you can evaluate the leaf nodes correctly, it will help you understand how to evaluate the entire tree."

      "content": "Remember that each internal node can be either an AND, OR, or XOR operation. This will affect how you evaluate the node based on its children. Make sure to define how each operation works in terms of boolean logic."

      "content": "Consider how to evaluate the tree recursively. You can write a function that takes a node and returns the boolean result of that subtree. This function should handle both leaf nodes and internal nodes."

      "content": "When evaluating an internal node, you will need to consider the results of its children. Depending on the operation, you will combine these results to determine the value of the current node."
