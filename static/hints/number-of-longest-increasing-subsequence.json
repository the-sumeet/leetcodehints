      "content": "Start by understanding what an increasing subsequence is. An increasing subsequence is a sequence where each element is greater than the one before it. For example, in the array [1, 3, 5, 4, 7], [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7] are valid increasing subsequences."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you would find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS). You can use dynamic programming to maintain an array that keeps track of the longest subsequence length at each index."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you compute the lengths of the longest increasing subsequences, think about how you could also keep track of the number of ways to form these subsequences. You might need an additional array to count the number of subsequences that lead to each length."
    },
    {
      "content": "When iterating through the array, for each element, check all previous elements. If a previous element is less than the current element, you can potentially extend the increasing subsequence. Update both the length and count arrays accordingly."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where there are duplicate values in the array. For instance, in the array [2, 2, 2, 2, 2], the longest increasing subsequence has a length of 1, but there are multiple subsequences of that length."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to initialize your count array properly. If an element is the start of a new increasing subsequence, it should have a count of 1. This means each individual element can be considered as a subsequence of length 1."

    {
      "content": "After filling out your length and count arrays, you will need to find the maximum value in the length array. This value represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the maximum length, iterate through your count array to sum up the counts of all subsequences that match this maximum length. This will give you the total number of longest increasing subsequences."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as when the input array has only one element. In this case, the longest increasing subsequence is just that single element, and there is one way to form it."

      "content": "Finally, ensure that your algorithm runs efficiently, ideally in O(n^2) time complexity, given the constraints of the problem. You may also explore optimizations using binary search for an even faster solution."
