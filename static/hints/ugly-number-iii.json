      "content": "Start by understanding what an ugly number is. An ugly number is defined as a positive integer that is divisible by at least one of the three numbers: a, b, or c."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might generate ugly numbers. You could iterate through positive integers and check if each one is divisible by a, b, or c, but this approach may not be efficient for large values of n."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the properties of the numbers a, b, and c. If they are relatively prime, how would that affect the distribution of ugly numbers? Consider using the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to avoid generating all ugly numbers up to n. Instead, consider using binary search to find the nth ugly number. This can help you efficiently narrow down the search space."
    },
    {
      "content": "When using binary search, define a function that counts how many ugly numbers exist up to a certain number x. This function should leverage the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid double counting."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to handle the constraints carefully: n can be as large as 10^9, and the product of a, b, and c can be up to 10^18. Ensure your counting function remains efficient."
    },
    {
      "content": "In your counting function, you will need to calculate how many numbers are divisible by a, b, and c, as well as their combinations using the LCM to avoid double counting."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to consider edge cases, such as when a, b, or c are equal. This could affect the counting of ugly numbers significantly."
    },
    {
      "content": "The binary search will work between 1 and 2 * 10^9. Set your initial low and high values accordingly, and remember to adjust your mid-point based on the count of ugly numbers."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, implement the binary search and the counting function together. Your goal is to find the smallest number x such that the count of ugly numbers up to x is at least n."
