      "content": "Start by understanding the operations you can perform on the substrings. You can replace a character, swap two characters, or reverse the substring. Think about how these operations can be combined to achieve the transformation from `word1` to `word2`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the lengths of `word1` and `word2`. They are guaranteed to be equal. This means you can focus on transforming the characters without worrying about adding or removing any."
    },
    {
      "content": "Take a closer look at the characters in both strings. Are there any characters in `word1` that are not in `word2`? If so, you will need to replace them, which counts as an operation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how you can group characters into substrings. The way you divide `word1` can significantly affect the number of operations needed. Try to identify contiguous segments where characters can be transformed into their counterparts in `word2`."
    },
    {
      "content": "When analyzing substrings, consider the frequency of characters. If a character appears more times in `word1` than in `word2`, you may need to replace some of those characters to match the required counts."

    {
      "content": "For each substring, keep track of the number of operations performed. You can create a function that counts the operations needed for each substring and returns the total."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you can only use each character in a substring once for each type of operation. This constraint can limit how you can manipulate the substrings, so plan your operations carefully."

      "content": "Consider edge cases where the strings are already identical. In this case, no operations are needed, and you should return 0."

    {
      "content": "Think about the impact of reversing a substring. Sometimes, reversing can help you get closer to the desired configuration more efficiently than swapping or replacing characters."

    {
      "content": "You might want to create a mapping of character positions from `word1` to `word2`. This can help visualize how characters need to be rearranged or replaced."

    {
      "content": "As you implement your solution, consider using a greedy approach where you try to minimize operations for each substring before moving on to the next. This can help reduce the total number of operations."

    {
      "content": "Keep in mind that swapping two characters can only happen if they are in the same substring. Make sure your substring divisions allow for effective swaps."

      "content": "If you find that a substring can be transformed into another with fewer operations than expected, try to identify why that is and adjust your substring divisions accordingly."

      "content": "When you reach the end of your substring analysis, sum up the operations for all substrings to get your final answer. Make sure to account for each operation type correctly."
