      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input array. Each task is represented as a pair: [actual_i, minimum_i]. The first element is the energy spent to complete the task, while the second is the minimum energy required to start it."

      "content": "Consider how the order of tasks affects your ability to complete them. Some tasks may require more energy to start than others, so think about how to prioritize them."

      "content": "Identify the minimum energy required to start each task. This is crucial because if your current energy is less than minimum_i for any task, you cannot start that task."

    {
      "content": "Think about the concept of 'net energy' after completing a task. After finishing a task, your energy decreases by actual_i. This means you will need to ensure you have enough energy to both start and finish tasks."

      "content": "To find the minimum initial energy, you can simulate the process of completing the tasks. Start with an initial guess and check if you can finish all tasks."

    {
      "content": "When performing the binary search, for each mid-point energy value, simulate the completion of tasks. If you can finish all tasks with that energy, try a lower value; otherwise, increase it."

    {
      "content": "Keep track of your current energy as you simulate completing tasks. If at any point your energy drops below the minimum required for the next task, that initial guess is too low."
