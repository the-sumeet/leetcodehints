      "content": "Start by understanding the movement of a knight in chess. A knight moves in an 'L' shape: two squares in one direction and then one square perpendicular, or vice versa. Make sure to visualize this movement on an 8x8 chessboard."

    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the chessboard in your code. A 2D array is a common choice. Each cell can be marked to indicate whether it has been visited by the knight."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to keep track of the knight's position. You will need to maintain the current coordinates and also a count of how many moves have been made so far."
    },
    {
      "content": "Implement a recursive backtracking algorithm. This means you will try to move the knight to a new position, and if it leads to a solution, you keep going; if not, you backtrack and try a different move."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to check the boundaries of the board before making a move. The knight should not move outside the 8x8 grid, so implement a function to validate the new position."

    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases such as starting from corners or edges of the board. These positions have fewer possible moves, which can affect your algorithm's performance."

      "content": "You may want to implement a way to track the path taken by the knight. This can help in visualizing the tour and debugging your algorithm."

    {
      "content": "Think about the base case for your recursion: when should you stop? A complete knight's tour occurs when the knight has visited every square on the board exactly once."
    },
    {
      "content": "To optimize your solution, consider using Warnsdorffâ€™s rule, which suggests moving the knight to the square with the fewest onward moves. This can help reduce the number of backtracking steps."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct format. You might want to return the sequence of moves or a boolean indicating whether a tour was found. Think about how you will represent this in your return statement."

    "The knight's tour can start from any position on the board.",
    "The board is typically 8x8, but ensure your implementation can handle different sizes if required.",
    "Each square must be visited exactly once for a valid tour.",
    "Consider the performance of your algorithm, especially for larger boards or different starting positions."
