    {
      "content": "Remember that node 0 is the root of the tree. This means it has no parent (indicated by -1). When processing the tree, you will always begin from this root node."

      "content": "The string `s` provides a character for each node. For example, `s[0]` corresponds to node 0. You'll need to compare characters between nodes and their ancestors to determine if a change in parent should occur."

      "content": "When trying to find the closest ancestor `y` of node `x` such that `s[x] == s[y]`, consider traversing up the tree using the `parent` array. This will involve a loop that continues until you reach the root or find a matching character."
