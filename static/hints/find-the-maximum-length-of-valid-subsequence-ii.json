      "content": "Consider the condition for a valid subsequence: the sum of every two consecutive elements in the subsequence must yield the same remainder when divided by k. This means you need to keep track of the remainders of sums of pairs of elements."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can represent the pairs of elements in terms of their remainders. For any two elements `a` and `b`, the condition can be expressed as `(a + b) % k`. This will help you categorize elements based on their remainders."

      "content": "You might want to create a frequency map or count of how many numbers yield each possible remainder when divided by k. This will help you understand how many elements you can include in your subsequence based on their remainders."

      "content": "As you build your solution, keep track of the maximum length of valid subsequences you can form. This will likely involve comparing lengths based on the remainders you encounter."
