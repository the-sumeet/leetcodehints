      "content": "Start by understanding how to determine if a point is inside a circle. A point (x, y) is inside a circle centered at (cx, cy) with radius r if the distance from the point to the center is less than or equal to r. This can be checked using the formula: (x - cx)² + (y - cy)² <= r²."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the input format carefully. You have an array of points and an array of queries. Each point is represented as [x, y], and each query as [cx, cy, r]. Make sure you can access these elements correctly in your code."

      "content": "Before diving into the solution, think about how to iterate through the points for each query. A nested loop might be the most straightforward approach where you check each point against each query."
