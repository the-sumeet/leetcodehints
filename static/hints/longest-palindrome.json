      "content": "Start by thinking about the properties of a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. For a string to form a palindrome, characters must appear in pairs, with at most one character allowed to appear an odd number of times."

    {
      "content": "Consider how you can count the occurrences of each character in the string. You might want to use a data structure like a dictionary or a frequency array to keep track of these counts."
    },
    {
      "content": "When counting character frequencies, remember that both uppercase and lowercase letters are treated as distinct characters. For example, 'A' and 'a' should be counted separately."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the counts of each character, think about how to calculate the maximum length of the palindrome. You can sum the counts of characters that appear an even number of times directly."
    },
    {
      "content": "For characters that appear an odd number of times, you can use all but one of those characters to contribute to the palindrome length. For example, if a character appears 5 times, you can use 4 of them."
    },
    {
      "content": "After considering all characters, if there are any characters with odd counts, you can add 1 to the total length. This accounts for a single character that can sit in the middle of the palindrome."

    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the input string is very short (like a single character). In such cases, the longest palindrome is simply the character itself."

      "content": "When calculating the final length of the palindrome, ensure that you are iterating through your frequency counts correctly and applying the rules for odd and even counts."

    {
      "content": "As a final step, ensure your solution runs efficiently within the constraints. Given that the maximum length of the string is 2000, aim for a solution that runs in linear time, O(n)."
