      "content": "Consider the input as a list of strings. Each string represents a row in the word square. The length of each string should be equal to the number of strings in the list to form a valid square."

      "content": "Check if the input list is empty or if the first string is empty. An empty list or an empty string means there can be no valid word square. What should you return in these cases?"

      "content": "Think about how to access characters in the strings. For a word square of size n, you can access the character at row i and column j using `words[i][j]`. Ensure that you do not go out of bounds."

      "content": "To validate the word square, you need to compare each character in the ith row with the corresponding character in the ith column. This means you will need a nested loop to iterate through the characters."

      "content": "Before concluding, ensure that you have checked all rows against their corresponding columns. If all checks pass, then the word square is valid."
