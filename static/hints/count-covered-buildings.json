      "content": "Consider how you can represent the buildings in the grid. Since the coordinates are unique, using a set to store the buildings might be a good approach for quick lookups."

      "content": "To check if a building at coordinates (x, y) is covered, you will need to check for buildings at (x-1, y), (x+1, y), (x, y-1), and (x, y+1)."

      "content": "Think about how to iterate through the list of buildings. You can loop through each building and check the four directions for the presence of other buildings."

      "content": "Keep in mind the constraints of the grid. Since buildings are within a range from 1 to n, ensure that your checks for neighboring buildings do not go out of bounds."

      "content": "Remember to handle edge cases, such as when there are very few buildings. For example, if there's only one building, it cannot be covered."

      "content": "You may want to create a helper function that checks if a building is covered by checking the four potential neighboring coordinates."
