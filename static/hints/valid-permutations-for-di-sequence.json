    {
      "content": "Consider the length of the string `s`. If `s` has a length of `n`, then you are dealing with `n + 1` numbers (from 0 to n). Make sure you understand how the characters in `s` relate to the indices of the permutation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the implications of the characters 'D' and 'I'. For example, if `s[i]` is 'I', then the permutation must increase at that index, which means `perm[i] < perm[i + 1]`. Conversely, 'D' means it must decrease, so `perm[i] > perm[i + 1]`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Try to visualize how the characters in `s` create constraints on the permutation. For example, if you have a sequence like 'DID', how does that split the numbers into groups that must be arranged in a certain way?"

    {
      "content": "When building your DP solution, think about how to transition from `dp[i]` to `dp[i + 1]`. You will need to account for the constraints imposed by `s[i]` when calculating the number of valid permutations."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `s` is all 'I's or all 'D's. What patterns emerge in the valid permutations for these cases? This can help you identify potential optimizations."

      "content": "Think about how to handle large numbers. Since the result needs to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`, make sure to apply the modulo operation at each step of your calculations to prevent overflow."

      "content": "As you develop your solution, keep testing with small inputs to ensure your logic holds. For instance, try `s = 'D'` and `s = 'I'` to see if the outputs match your expectations."

      "content": "Consider how the number of 'D's and 'I's in `s` affects the total number of valid permutations. Is there a relationship between the counts of 'D' and 'I' and the number of valid arrangements?"
