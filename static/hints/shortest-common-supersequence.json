      "content": "Consider the lengths of the two input strings. The shortest common supersequence (SCS) must be at least as long as the longer of the two strings. This gives you a lower bound on the length of your result."

    {
      "content": "A common approach to finding the SCS is to use dynamic programming. You can create a 2D table where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the SCS of the first `i` characters of `str1` and the first `j` characters of `str2`."

      "content": "Initialize your DP table. The first row and first column should be filled based on the lengths of the strings. For instance, `dp[i][0]` should equal `i` (length of `str1` up to `i`) and `dp[0][j]` should equal `j` (length of `str2` up to `j`)."

      "content": "When filling the DP table, if the characters at `str1[i-1]` and `str2[j-1]` are the same, you can take the value from `dp[i-1][j-1]` and add 1 to it. This indicates that you can extend the SCS by this matching character."

      "content": "If the characters are different, you need to consider both possibilities: either take the character from `str1` or from `str2`. The value for `dp[i][j]` in this case will be 1 plus the minimum of the two possible lengths: `dp[i-1][j]` and `dp[i][j-1]`."

      "content": "If the characters do not match, check which direction you came from in the DP table. If you moved from the left, it means you should add the character from `str2`, and if you moved from above, add the character from `str1`."
