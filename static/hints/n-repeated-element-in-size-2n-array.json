      "content": "Start by understanding the properties of the array. You have an array of length 2N, which means it contains exactly N + 1 unique elements. This is key to solving the problem."
    },
    {
      "content": "Identify that one of these unique elements is repeated exactly N times. This means that if you count the occurrences of each element, one element will appear N times while all others will appear once."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might count the occurrences of each element in the array. You could use a hash map (or dictionary) to store the count of each element as you iterate through the array."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you iterate through the array, update your count for each element. Remember to check if an element's count reaches N during this process. What would you do when you find such an element?"

      "content": "Think about edge cases. What if the array has the minimum size? For example, if N = 1, the array would be [x, x]. How would your approach handle this?"

      "content": "You might also consider using a different approach, like using a set to track seen elements. If you encounter an element that's already in the set, you know it's the repeated element."

      "content": "If you choose to use a set, remember that you will need to check if the element is already in the set before adding it. This will help you identify the repeated element efficiently."
