    {
      "content": "Consider the implications of the grouping condition: if node A is in group x, then any node B connected to A must be in group x-1 or x+1. This suggests a relationship similar to a bipartite graph."

      "content": "Think about how you can represent the graph. An adjacency list or adjacency matrix can be useful for storing the edges between nodes."

      "content": "Since the graph can be disconnected, you will need to handle each connected component separately. How can you identify all the components in the graph?"

      "content": "Use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to explore the graph. As you traverse, you can attempt to assign groups to nodes based on their neighbors."

    {
      "content": "While traversing, maintain a record of the group assigned to each node. If you find a conflict (e.g., two connected nodes assigned to the same group), then grouping is impossible."
