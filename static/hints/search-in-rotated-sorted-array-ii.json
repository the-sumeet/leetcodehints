      "content": "Consider how you would normally search in a sorted array using binary search. Think about how the rotation affects the mid-point and how you can determine which half of the array is sorted."
    },
    {
      "content": "When examining the mid-point, you need to compare it with the left and right boundaries. This will help you decide which side to search next. For example, if nums[mid] is greater than nums[left], the left half is sorted."
    },
    {
      "content": "Take note of the presence of duplicates in the array. This can complicate the decision-making process when determining which side to search. If nums[mid] equals nums[left] or nums[right], you might need to increment the left or decrement the right pointer to skip duplicates."

    {
      "content": "If the left side is sorted, check if the target lies within that range. If it does, adjust your search to that side; otherwise, search the other side. For example, if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid], search left."
