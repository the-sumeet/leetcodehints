      "content": "Consider how you would traverse the binary tree. You can use either Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS). Think about which method might be more suitable for finding the shortest path to a leaf node."
    },
    {
      "content": "If you choose BFS, remember that it explores all nodes at the present depth level before moving on to nodes at the next depth level. This property can help you find the minimum depth more efficiently."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your traversal, keep track of the current depth as you move down the tree. This will help you compare depths and find the minimum as you encounter leaf nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle edge cases, such as when the tree is empty. In this case, what should your function return? Consider returning a depth of 0 for an empty tree."

    {
      "content": "As you traverse the tree, you should check if a node is a leaf node. If it is, compare its depth with the current minimum depth and update accordingly."

    {
      "content": "Think about how to manage the case where a node has only one child. You need to ensure that you still explore all paths down to leaf nodes, even if some branches are shorter."

    {
      "content": "If you're using recursion, consider how you will return the minimum depth from the recursive calls. You might want to return a special value when you reach a leaf node."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to consider the return value of your function. It should be an integer representing the minimum depth of the tree. Make sure to test your function with various tree structures."
    },
    {
      "content": "You are very close! To finalize your approach, think about how you can combine your depth tracking with the traversal logic to ensure you return the minimum depth correctly. Pseudocode might look like: `if node is null return 0; if node is a leaf return current depth;`"
