      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input array `nums`. Each element is a non-negative power of 2. This means that the elements can be represented as `2^k` for some integer `k`."

      "content": "Consider the goal: you need to form a subsequence that sums up to the `target`. A subsequence can be formed by selecting elements from `nums` while maintaining their order."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how the operations affect the array. When you choose an element `nums[i] > 1`, you replace it with two occurrences of `nums[i] / 2`. This effectively increases the number of smaller elements in the array."

    {
      "content": "Before diving into operations, check if the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than the `target`. If it is, immediately return -1 since it's impossible to form the target."

      "content": "Count how many of each power of 2 you have in `nums`. This will help you determine how many of each element you can use to reach the `target`."

      "content": "Keep track of the number of operations performed. Each time you split a number, you increase the operation count by 1."

    {
      "content": "When considering which number to split, prioritize larger numbers first, as they can produce more smaller numbers that can contribute to the `target`."

      "content": "Remember that you can only split numbers greater than 1. This means that once you reach 1s in your array, they cannot be split further."

      "content": "If you reach a point where you cannot split any more numbers and still haven't met the `target`, you should return -1."

    {

      "content": "You can also think about using a priority queue (or max-heap) to efficiently get the largest element to split at each step."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you process the numbers, keep a running total of the current sum you can achieve with the available numbers. This will help you know when you've reached or exceeded the `target`."

      "content": "If you ever find that the current sum equals the `target`, you can immediately return the number of operations performed up to that point."
