      "content": "Think about how to efficiently count '0's and '1's in a substring. A naive approach would involve counting for every substring, which could be too slow. Consider using prefix sums to store cumulative counts of '0's and '1's."

      "content": "When you preprocess the string with prefix sums, create two arrays: one for the count of '0's and another for the count of '1's. This will allow you to quickly calculate the number of '0's or '1's in any substring defined by indices l and r."

      "content": "Remember that for any substring s[l..r], you can calculate the number of '0's as: count_0 = prefix_0[r + 1] - prefix_0[l]. Similarly, calculate the number of '1's using the prefix sums for '1's."
