      "content": "# Hint 2\nFocus on identifying leaf nodes. A leaf node is defined as a node that has no left or right children. You will need to traverse the tree to find these nodes."
    },
    {
      "content": "# Hint 3\nConsider using a recursive approach to traverse the tree. You can use a post-order traversal (left-right-root) to ensure that you check and potentially delete child nodes before dealing with their parents."

    {
      "content": "# Hint 4\nWhen checking if a node is a leaf, compare its value to the target. If it matches and is a leaf, it should be removed. Think about how you will handle the parent nodes after deletion."

      "content": "# Hint 5\nAfter deleting a leaf node, you need to check if its parent node has become a leaf node with the target value. This is a recursive condition that may require multiple passes through the tree."

      "content": "# Hint 6\nMake sure to handle edge cases, such as when the tree only has one node, or when all nodes are leaves with the target value. What should your function return in these cases?"

      "content": "# Hint 7\nThink about how you will return the modified tree. You might want to return the root of the tree after all deletions have been made. Consider how you will manage null values."

      "content": "# Hint 9\nAs you implement the deletion logic, remember to return the updated node from your recursive function. If a node is deleted, return null to its parent."
