      "content": "Start by understanding the problem requirements. You need to create at least `k` non-overlapping subarrays of size `x` where all elements are equal. Think about how to group elements in `nums` into these subarrays."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you can calculate the cost of making all elements in a subarray equal. For a subarray of size `x`, if you want to make all elements equal to a target value, you will need to compute the total operations needed for each element in that subarray."

    {
      "content": "To find the minimum operations for a subarray, you can iterate through the subarray and calculate the difference between each element and the target value, summing the absolute differences."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can choose a target value for the subarrays. A good starting point could be the median of the subarray, as it minimizes the sum of absolute differences."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you need to find `k` non-overlapping subarrays. This means that once you decide on a subarray, you cannot include any of its elements in another subarray."

      "content": "As you calculate the costs for each subarray, store them in a list. You will need to sort this list to help you find the minimum costs for selecting `k` non-overlapping subarrays."

      "content": "When selecting `k` subarrays, ensure that you maintain the non-overlapping condition. You can keep track of the end index of the last selected subarray to enforce this."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases, such as when `k` is 1. In this case, you only need to find the minimum operations for a single subarray of size `x`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. The maximum length of `nums` is 100,000, which means your solution needs to be efficient, ideally O(n log n) or O(n)."

      "content": "To finalize your approach, consider how to efficiently compute the minimum operations for each possible configuration of `k` subarrays. This might involve a combination of sorting and dynamic programming."
