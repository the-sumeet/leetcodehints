      "content": "Consider the worst-case scenario for your egg drops. Each drop can provide you with information about the range of floors where f might be located. Think about how to balance the number of drops between the two eggs."

      "content": "With two eggs, if the first egg breaks, you can only use the second egg to check the floors below. This means you need a strategy that allows you to maximize the information gained from each drop."

      "content": "A common approach is to use a decreasing step strategy. For example, if you drop the first egg from floor x and it breaks, you can then use the second egg to check all floors below x. How would you choose x to minimize the total drops?"

      "content": "Think about the mathematical relationship between the number of drops and the floors you can check. If you drop from floor x and it breaks, you can check x-1 floors with the second egg. If it doesn't break, you can check the remaining floors above x."

      "content": "Try to formulate a relationship between the number of drops (d) and the floors (n). For example, if you drop from floor 1, then 2, then 3, etc., how does that relate to the total number of floors you can check?"

      "content": "You can use a binary search approach on the number of drops to find the minimum number of drops required. Start with a guess and adjust based on whether the number of floors can be covered with that many drops."

    {
      "content": "Finally, think about how to optimize your approach. You want to find the minimum number of moves, so ensure that your strategy accounts for both eggs effectively. You might end up with a formula that combines the drops from both eggs to cover all floors."
