      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to merge two strings in a way that results in the lexicographically largest string possible. Remember that you can only take the first character from either string at each step."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to compare the two strings. When deciding which character to take, think about the entire remaining substring of both strings. This is crucial for determining which option will lead to a larger merge."

    {
      "content": "Think about edge cases where one string might be exhausted before the other. How will you handle the remaining characters? Make sure your solution accounts for this scenario."
    },
    {
      "content": "You can use a greedy approach to solve this problem. At each step, compare the two strings and choose the character that leads to a larger result. This means you should look ahead at the remaining characters in both strings."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider using a loop that continues until both strings are empty. Inside the loop, implement the logic to compare the two strings and append the appropriate character to the result."

    {
      "content": "When comparing the two strings, you can use a simple comparison: if `word1` is lexicographically larger than `word2`, take the character from `word1`, otherwise take from `word2`."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the comparison should be done on the remaining substrings. For instance, if `word1 = 'abc'` and `word2 = 'ab'`, you should compare 'abc' with 'ab' and take 'a' from `word1`."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you build the merge string, keep track of the indices or lengths of `word1` and `word2` to know when to stop. You can also use a while loop that checks if either string is not empty."
    },
    {
      "content": "Make sure to handle all characters from both strings. After the main loop, if one string is still non-empty, append the remaining characters to the result."

    {
      "content": "Your final implementation should return the merged string. Ensure that the return format matches the problem's requirements, which is just a single string."
