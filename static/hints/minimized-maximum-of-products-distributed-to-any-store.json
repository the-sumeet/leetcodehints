      "content": "Think about how you can distribute the products. If a product type has a large quantity, it might be beneficial to distribute it across multiple stores to keep `x` low."

      "content": "In your binary search, for a mid value of `x`, check if it's feasible to distribute all products such that no store receives more than `x` products. This will involve some calculations based on the quantities."

    {
      "content": "To check feasibility, iterate through each product type and calculate how many stores can be filled with that product type if each store can receive at most `x` products. Use the formula: `stores_needed = ceil(quantities[i] / x)`."

      "content": "Sum the number of stores needed for all product types and compare it to `n`. If the total is less than or equal to `n`, then `x` is feasible."

      "content": "Consider how to efficiently implement the binary search and feasibility check. You might want to define a helper function for the feasibility check to keep your code organized."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your binary search narrows down correctly. If `x` is feasible, try a smaller value; if not, increase `x`. This will help you zero in on the minimum maximum value."
