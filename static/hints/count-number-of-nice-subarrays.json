      "content": "Think about how you can iterate through the array to count the number of odd numbers. You might want to maintain a count of odd numbers as you explore different subarrays."

      "content": "You can utilize two pointers to manage the left and right ends of your current subarray. When the count of odd numbers exceeds `k`, you should move the left pointer to reduce the count."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when `k` is equal to the total number of odd numbers in the array. How does this affect your counting logic?"

      "content": "When you find a valid subarray with exactly `k` odd numbers, think about how to count all subarrays that can be formed by varying the start and end points. You might need to count how many odd numbers are before and after your current subarray."
