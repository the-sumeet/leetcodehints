      "content": "Start by understanding the structure of the input. The input consists of a 'headers' object and a 'rows' object. The 'Terms' key in both should guide how you process the data."
    },
    {
      "content": "Focus on the 'Terms' array in the 'rows' object. Each term is represented by a pair of values: 'power' and 'factor'. Make sure you know how to interpret these pairs."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how you might represent a polynomial equation using the 'power' and 'factor' values. Each term contributes to the overall polynomial, so think about how to combine them."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the 'power' values indicate the degree of each term. Higher powers correspond to terms that grow faster as the input increases, while lower powers may contribute less significantly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Check if the powers are unique. If they are not, you may need to combine terms with the same power when constructing the equation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to handle negative factors. A negative factor means that the term will subtract from the overall polynomial value, which could affect the final output format."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you build the polynomial, consider the order in which terms should be presented. Typically, terms are arranged in descending order of their power."
    },
    {
      "content": "When combining terms with the same power, ensure that you sum their factors correctly. This could involve maintaining a temporary dictionary or list to track sums."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to edge cases, such as when all factors are zero, or when there are multiple terms with the same power but different factors. How would you represent these?"
    },
    {
      "content": "After processing the input, you should have a structured representation of the polynomial. Think about how to convert this structure back into a string format that represents the equation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to format the output string. You might need to handle cases where the factor is 1 or -1 differently to avoid redundancy in the equation."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember to include '+' and '-' signs appropriately between terms in the final string. This will require checking the sign of each factor."
    },
    {
      "content": "Use a loop to iterate through your structured terms and build the final equation string step by step. This will help ensure that you don't miss any terms."
    },
    {
      "content": "Don't forget to handle the case where the polynomial might simplify to just a constant. What happens if all terms cancel out?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your output matches the expected format exactly. This includes proper spacing and the correct use of mathematical notation."
