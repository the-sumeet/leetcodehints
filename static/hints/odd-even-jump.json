Odd jumps require you to jump to the smallest index with a value greater than or equal to the current index's value, while even jumps require the largest index with a value less than or equal."

      "content": "Consider how you can represent the jumps. You might want to create a function that, given an index, returns the next index you can jump to based on whether it's an odd or even jump."
