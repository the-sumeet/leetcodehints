      "content": "Start by understanding what a subsequence is. A subsequence can be formed by deleting some elements from the array without changing the order of the remaining elements. For instance, from [1, 2, 3], you can form subsequences like [1, 2] or [2, 3]."

      "content": "Consider how you might approach finding all possible subsequences. You could use recursion or backtracking to explore all combinations of elements in the array. Think about how you would keep track of the current sum as you explore these combinations."

    {
      "content": "Remember that you only need to keep track of subsequences that sum to the target. If a subsequence's sum exceeds the target, you can prune that path early. This will help optimize your solution."

    {
      "content": "As you explore subsequences, maintain a count of the length of each valid subsequence that sums to the target. You will need to compare lengths to find the longest one. Consider using a variable to store the maximum length found."

      "content": "Think about how to handle cases where no valid subsequence exists. You should return -1 in such cases. Make sure to check this condition after you have explored all possible subsequences."

      "content": "Given the constraints (1 <= nums.length <= 1000), your solution should be efficient. Using a brute-force approach to generate all subsequences could lead to exponential time complexity. Consider using dynamic programming or memoization to improve efficiency."

      "content": "Dynamic programming could be a good approach here. You might want to create a 2D array where one dimension represents the index of the current element and the other dimension represents the current sum. This could help you keep track of the maximum length of subsequences that sum to each possible target."

    {
      "content": "When implementing your dynamic programming solution, consider how to fill in your DP table. For each element, you can either include it in the subsequence or exclude it. Make sure to update your maximum length accordingly."

      "content": "As you build your solution, ensure you handle edge cases, such as when all elements are larger than the target. You might also want to test your function with arrays that contain duplicate values to see how they affect the subsequences."

    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the correct value. If you find valid subsequences, return the length of the longest one; otherwise, return -1. A good way to structure your return statement is to check the maximum length variable you maintained."
