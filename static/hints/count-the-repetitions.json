      "content": "When forming `str1` and `str2`, remember that the lengths of these strings can become very large due to the repetition counts (`n1` and `n2`). Instead of actually constructing these large strings, think about how you can work with their properties directly."

      "content": "To check if `s2` can be formed from `s1`, you can use a two-pointer technique. One pointer will traverse `s1` while the other traverses `s2`. This will help you efficiently determine if `s2` is a subsequence of `s1`."
