      "content": "Start by understanding how to calculate the power of an integer. You need to implement a function that counts the number of steps to reduce an integer to 1 using the given rules."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that the steps depend on whether the integer is odd or even. You can use a loop to apply the transformation until the integer becomes 1."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider creating a helper function that takes an integer and returns its power value. This will help you keep your main logic clean."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the power values for all integers in the range [lo, hi], you'll need to store these values along with their corresponding integers."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to sort the integers based on their power values. You can use a list of tuples where each tuple contains (power_value, integer)."
    },
    {
      "content": "When sorting, remember that if two integers have the same power value, they should be sorted by their integer value. This can be done using Python's built-in sort functionality."
    },
    {
      "content": "After sorting, your result will be a list of integers ordered by their power values. Make sure to extract the k-th integer from this sorted list."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the indexing. Since k is 1-based in the problem statement, you will need to access the (k-1)th index in your sorted list."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when lo equals hi. In this case, the range only contains one integer, and you should return that integer directly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your implementation handles the maximum constraints efficiently, as the range can go up to 1000. Think about the time complexity of your solution."
