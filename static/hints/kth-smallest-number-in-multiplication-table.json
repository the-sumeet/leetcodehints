      "content": "Notice that the values in the multiplication table are not unique. For instance, `2` appears multiple times (e.g., `1*2`, `2*1`). How will this affect your approach to finding the k-th smallest number?"

      "content": "Set your binary search bounds: `low = 1` and `high = m * n`. In each iteration, calculate `mid = (low + high) // 2` and use it to count how many numbers are less than or equal to `mid`."
