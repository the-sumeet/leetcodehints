    {
      "content": "Once you have the last digit, think about how you can build the reversed number. You can initialize a variable to hold the reversed integer and multiply it by 10 before adding the last digit."

      "content": "Remember to remove the last digit from the original number after processing it. You can do this using integer division: `x = x // 10`."

      "content": "As you build the reversed integer, keep an eye on the potential overflow. A signed 32-bit integer ranges from -2^31 to 2^31 - 1. You will need to check if the reversed number exceeds these bounds."

      "content": "To check for overflow, you can compare the reversed integer against the maximum and minimum values before you finalize the return value. If it exceeds these bounds, return 0."

    {
      "content": "You should also consider what happens when reversing leads to a number that is not valid in the 32-bit range. For instance, reversing 1534236469 would lead to a number that exceeds the maximum limit."

    {
      "content": "When you construct the reversed number, remember to account for the sign of the original integer. If the original integer was negative, the final result should also be negative."
