      "content": "Consider how you can identify the boundaries of strictly increasing subarrays. You can iterate through the array and check if the current element is greater than the previous one. If it is not, you've reached the end of a strictly increasing subarray."

      "content": "Think about how you can keep track of the length of the current strictly increasing subarray. You might want to use a variable to count the length of the current subarray as you iterate through the array."

      "content": "When you find the end of a strictly increasing subarray, you need to add the number of valid subarrays that can be formed from that length. For a subarray of length 'n', the number of strictly increasing subarrays is given by the formula: n * (n + 1) / 2."

      "content": "Make sure to handle cases where the array has repeated elements. For example, in the array [1, 3, 5, 4, 4, 6], the two '4's do not contribute to a strictly increasing subarray, so your logic should account for this."
