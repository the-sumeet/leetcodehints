      "content": "Consider how you can iterate through the arrays. For Type 1, you will need to loop through `nums1` for `i`, and then use two nested loops for `j` and `k` in `nums2`. For Type 2, reverse the roles of the arrays."

    {
      "content": "When checking for Type 1 triplets, remember that `j` must be less than `k`. This means you should only consider pairs of indices in `nums2` where `j < k`. How will you enforce this in your loops?"

      "content": "Think about how you can efficiently compute the products of pairs in `nums2`. You might want to use a hash map to store the frequency of each product, which can help you avoid redundant calculations."
