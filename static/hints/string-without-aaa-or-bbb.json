      "content": "A good approach is to alternate between 'a' and 'b'. However, you need to be careful not to place too many of the same letter in a row. How can you balance the letters while adhering to the constraints?"

    {
      "content": "If one letter count is significantly larger than the other, you may need to place two of the larger letter followed by one of the smaller letter. For example, if `a` is much larger than `b`, you might consider a pattern like 'aab'."

      "content": "As you build the string, keep track of the last letter added. This will help you avoid adding a third consecutive letter of the same type."
