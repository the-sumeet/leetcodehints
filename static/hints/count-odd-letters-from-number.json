      "content": "Start by understanding the problem statement clearly. You need to count the number of letters in the English alphabet representation of a given number. For example, the number 41 translates to 'forty-one'."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how numbers are represented in words. Each digit and its place value contribute to the final word. For instance, 'twenty' represents 20, and 'forty' represents 40."

      "content": "Break down the problem into smaller parts. First, write a function that converts a number into its English word representation. You might want to handle numbers from 1 to 99 as a starting point."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to count letters. After converting the number to its word form, you will need to filter out any non-letter characters (like hyphens or spaces) before counting."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that you are only interested in odd letters. You will need to define what constitutes an 'odd' letter. For example, 'a', 'c', 'e', etc., are odd in terms of their position in the alphabet."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as the number 0 or negative numbers. How should your function handle these cases? Make sure your function can handle a range of inputs."
    },
    {
      "content": "When counting letters, think about how you will iterate through the string representation of the number. You can use a loop or a list comprehension to count the odd letters."
    },
    {
      "content": "You might want to create a helper function that determines if a letter is odd based on its position in the alphabet. This function can be reused when counting letters."
    },
    {
      "content": "Before finalizing your solution, consider testing it with various inputs, including edge cases. For example, what happens with inputs like 1, 10, or 99?"
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure that your function returns the correct count of odd letters. You might want to print or return the result in a specific format, such as an integer count."

  "questionNotes": [
    "The input number can be any non-negative integer.",
    "Focus on numbers from 0 to 99 for simplicity, and ensure your function handles each case correctly.",
    "The output should be the count of odd letters in the English representation of the number."
