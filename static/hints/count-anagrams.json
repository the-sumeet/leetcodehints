      "content": "Remember that anagrams of a word are permutations of its letters. To count anagrams, you will need to consider the frequency of each character in each word."

    {
      "content": "However, if there are repeated characters in a word, you need to divide by the factorial of the counts of each character to avoid overcounting. For example, for the word 'aabb', the number of distinct permutations is `4! / (2! * 2!)`."
