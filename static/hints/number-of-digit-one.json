      "content": "Consider how you would approach counting the occurrences of '1' in a small range, like from 0 to 20. This can help you identify patterns in how '1's appear in different positions (units, tens, etc.)."

      "content": "For a given digit position, you can categorize the numbers into three groups: those less than the current digit, those equal to it, and those greater than it. This will help you calculate how many '1's appear based on the digit's value."
