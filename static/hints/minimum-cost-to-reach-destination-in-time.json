      "content": "Start by understanding the problem's structure. You have cities connected by roads, and you need to find a path from city 0 to city n-1 while considering both travel time and passing fees."
    },
    {
      "content": "Review the input format carefully. You have a maximum time constraint (`maxTime`), a list of edges representing roads, and an array of passing fees for each city."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to represent the graph. You can use an adjacency list or a matrix to store the roads between cities, as there can be multiple roads between the same cities."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about the traversal method. Since you need to keep track of both time and cost, a modified Dijkstra's algorithm or a priority queue might be useful."
    },
    {
      "content": "When traversing the graph, remember that you need to accumulate both the time taken and the passing fees for each city you visit."
    },
    {
      "content": "Pay attention to the constraints. The maximum number of cities is 1000, and the maximum time is also 1000. Ensure your solution can handle these limits efficiently."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when there are no valid paths to the destination within the given time. Your function should return -1 in these cases."

      "content": "When implementing your algorithm, keep track of the minimum cost to reach each city within the allowed time. Use a data structure to store this information."

    {
      "content": "You might want to use a priority queue to always expand the least costly path first, similar to Dijkstra's algorithm, but also consider the time constraint."
    },
    {
      "content": "Ensure that when you visit a city, you only update the cost if the new cost is lower than the previously recorded cost for that city within the same time constraint."
    },
    {
      "content": "Consider how to handle multiple edges between two cities. You need to evaluate all possible edges to find the optimal path."

    {
      "content": "As you explore paths, keep track of the current time and cost. If you exceed `maxTime`, prune that path and do not continue exploring it."

    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to initialize your data structures. You may want to start with the cost to reach city 0 as its passing fee and time as 0."
    },
    {
      "content": "Finally, ensure your function returns the minimum cost found to reach the destination city n-1, or -1 if no valid path exists."
