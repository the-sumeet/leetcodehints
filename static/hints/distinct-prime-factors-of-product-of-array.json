      "content": "Start by understanding what prime factors are. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself. For example, the prime factors of 28 are 2 and 7."

      "content": "Consider how you can find the prime factors of individual numbers in the array. You might want to write a function that checks for prime factors of a single number first."
    },
    {
      "content": "Remember that when you multiply numbers together, the prime factors of the product are simply the union of the prime factors of the individual numbers. This means you don't need to compute the product directly."
    },
    {
      "content": "Think about how to efficiently find prime factors. You could use trial division up to the square root of each number to check for factors, or you could use a sieve method to precompute prime numbers up to 1000."
    },
    {
      "content": "As you find the prime factors for each number, store them in a data structure that automatically handles uniqueness. A set in Python is a good choice since it only keeps distinct elements."

      "content": "Consider the constraints of the problem. The maximum value for any number in the array is 1000, so you only need to find prime factors for numbers up to that limit."

      "content": "Make sure to handle edge cases, such as when the array contains the same number multiple times. The distinct prime factors should still be counted only once."

    {
      "content": "After iterating through the array and collecting all distinct prime factors, the final step is to return the count of these factors. The size of your set will give you this count."

    {
      "content": "You might want to implement a helper function to find the prime factors of a number. This function should return the prime factors as a set or list."
