      "content": "Consider how each character in the string 'word' contributes to forming the valid sequences. For instance, if you encounter a 'b' without an 'a' before it, you'll need to add an 'a' to make it valid."

      "content": "Think about the order of characters. If you have a 'c' without a preceding 'b', you will need to add both 'a' and 'b' before it. This will help you determine how many characters need to be inserted."

      "content": "Remember that the maximum length of the string is 50. This means your solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limits without unnecessary complexity."
