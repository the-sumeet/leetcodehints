    },
    {
      "content": "Consider the length of the array. Since the array has 2 * n elements, think about how many pairs you need to form. If the array length is odd or not a multiple of 2, itâ€™s impossible to form pairs."

    {
      "content": "Think about how you can count the occurrences of each number in the array. A good approach is to use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of how many times each number appears."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have the counts, consider what it means for a number to be able to form pairs. Specifically, each number must appear an even number of times to be paired completely."

    {
      "content": "As you analyze the counts, remember that if any number has an odd count, you can immediately conclude that forming pairs is impossible. This is a key insight."

      "content": "Consider edge cases, such as when the input array consists of the same number repeated or when there are multiple unique numbers with varying counts."

    {
      "content": "You might want to sort the array first to visualize the pairs better, but remember that sorting is not necessary for the solution. Focus on counting instead."
    },
    {
      "content": "Once you have your counts, iterate through the hash map. For each unique number, check if its count is even. If you find any odd count, return false immediately."
    },

      "content": "Finally, if you finish checking all counts and find them all even, you can confidently return true. This will indicate that it is possible to form the required pairs."
